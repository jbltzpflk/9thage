race	xx	dfaq:1-"<b>--Where can I go to report a Bug or make Suggestions?--</b>"-"Please use the <a href=http://www.phpbbplanet.com/anarchistica>WF7 Anarchistica's Army Builder Forum</a> to report bugs and make suggestions";dfaq:3-"<br><b>--General Info--</b>"-"";dfaq:4-"The File Manager"-"The 7th Edition Warhammer AB files are currently being maintained and updated by Ruben Malingré and Ryan E.

His email address is blazetopast@hotmail.com.";dfaq:5-"Changes in this Version"-"A full list of fixes can be found on the <a href=http://www.phpbbplanet.com/anarchistica>WF7 Anarchistica's Army Builder Forum</a>";dfaq:10-"Known Bugs/Inabilities of Code"-"- Cost and Number of Spec Chars magic items show up on the army summary,<br>- Ladders are not limited by size of unit,<br>- 7 Knights scenario may not work right,<br>- Strength bonus of both halberd/great weapon and any magic weapon are added up";dfaq:15-"Sources of Data"-"The army lists are based on information from the Ravening Hordes, Warhammer Annual 2002, Warhammer US Chronicles 2004, White Dwarf Magazine, Citadel Journal, GW Website, and the Empire, Orc and Goblin, Dwarf, Vampire Counts, Dark Elf, High Elf, Skaven, Hordes of Chaos, Tomb Kings, Lizardmen, and Beasts of Chaos Army Books.";dfaq:20-"Leading Bug Reporter"-"Now, who finds the bugs and reports them?  I get them from numerous users of the files.  Thanks to all who send in bug reports, or note additional special characters available on the GW Website, in supporting the project.";dfaq:21-"Credits"-"Thanks to anyone who has reported bugs and assisted in some other way. A short credits list can be found on the WFB AB Forum";dfaq:25-"List of Future Improvements"-"Future improvements are currently planned to include the new army books as they are released, additional streamlining of options that will make armor selection like the selection process for magic lores, add unit size to the Notes on each unit (currently done for Beastmen, Brettonians, DoW, Dark Elves, Dwarfs, Chaos Dwarfs, Chaos Warriors, Daemons, Empire, High Elves), adding abbreviations to all troops.";dfaq:30-"Rate of Versions"-"There is no scheduled rate of new versions of the files.  My goal is to limit the number of versions to not make individuals continually need to update their files.  Generally, a new version can be counted on coming out right after an Army Book release.";dfaq:35-"Non-English Versions"-"Version in French, German, and Spanish are being done by various people.";dfaq:36-"Stats/Abbreviations"-"The following stats and abbreviations not previously defined:<br> - CC : close combat, <br> - RiP : Remain in Play, <br> - Dp : Dispel Pool, <br> - Cp : Casting Pool, <br> - US : Unit Strength (per model!), <br> - ArSv : Armor Save, <br> - P is a stat for Daemons that showing generated casting dice.";dfaq:40-"<br><b>--Frequently Asked Questions--</b>"-"";dfaq:45-"Where are the Special Characters, Regiments of Reknown, Dogs of War and alternate units?"-"These have to be enabled to show in the Settings menu.";dfaq:50-"Why am I allowed to take 4 heroes in an army that is less than 2000 points?"-"Because the composition rules used by GW are at a different rate from <2000 and 2000+ pt armies, <2000 pt armies must select the '<2000 pts' Composition Rule Set, which is available under the Roster Menu.";dfaq:60-"Why can't I give my BSB a certain weapon/mount/option?"-"Many people have sent bug reports that making a hero into a BSB results in weapon or certain mount options not available. For those people, please read the rules for BSBs (and WD262) and you will note that they lose all equipment options but armor, barding, and a horselike mount or sometimes a chariot. This is why BSBs can not get magic shields or two-handed magic weapons because they have a standard in one hand.";dfaq:65-"Kislev Allied Contingent"-"To add an allied contingent to your army (only available to br, dow, dw, em, he, & we), select 'Kislev Allied Contingent' from the 'Allies for Army' drop down box at the top right corner of the AB window.  Select and equip units as normal.  Contingent units have their own hero/core/special/rare unit requirements which is separate from the requirements of the main army so the number of contingent units is not included in the tally for the number of main army units.  Points costs for allied contingent units (for example, points spent on Core Contingent units) will still be added to the total points spent on Core units for your army.";dfaq:70-"How do I stop 2 for 1 units from taking up 2 separate special/rare slots?"-"To add a second '2 for 1' unit, you can either add either use the '+' key to add a duplicate of the first unit, or if you would like different options for the second unit you can add another unit to your roster and select the 'Free' Choice option.";dfaq:71-"How do I create an Appendix or Alternate Army List?"-"Selection of the Appendix list must be done when selecting the Army's race when you first create the roster.";dfaq:75-"How can I create a Warhammer Skirmish list"-"To create a Warhammer Skirmish roster, when selecting your race change the Army List to 'Warhammer Skirmish'.  You must also select 'WH Skirmish' from the 'Roster'/'Composition Rule Set' menu to remove the core/special/rare restrictions.  In a Warhammer Skirmish list all units will have a minimum unit size of 1 and no General will be required.  All unit options like Standards, Musicians, etc are still available.  Make sure you read your scenario carefully to be sure which units and options you are or are not allowed.";dfaq:80-"Why isn't Army Builder including a certain unit in the total Core Unit count?"-"Units that are core but do not count towards the core limits (e.g., hobgoblins, chaos warhounds and huntsmen) will not be included in totalling the number of core units, although their points will be included in total number of core points.";dfaq:90-"Terse Notes"-"The notes on weapons, armor, spells, options, etc. have all been minimized in length for issues related to length of the printouts.  In all cases, the actual rules are the final description.  Use of the notes should not be utilized without good knowledge of the game/army rules.  For example-shields on foot troops generally note that a +1 save in HTH when used with handweapon.  In actuality, the rule only applies if the handweapon (and shield) are mundane (i.e., not magical).";dfaq:100-"Opponent's Approval"-"Opponent's Approval is a small reminder to players under the validation programming to note which units or rule's variations are unofficial.  For example, the army lists say that, if the opponent agrees, you can take DoW units as specials.  Therefore, there is an option in the files for units or alternate army list modifications (e.g., GW Website Spec Chars) but that requires opponent's approval.";dfaq:44-"Mounts & Riders"-"The extra Attack for Mounts with Frenzied riders is not shown in AB. The Strength bonus for mounted models with a great weapon is shown incorrectly as +2. This is due to the restrictions of the program."
