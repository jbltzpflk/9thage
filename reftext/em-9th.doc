Parent Units And Support Units
Certain units in this Army Book are designated as either Parent Units or Support Units. Support Units are considered Insignificant to Parent Units and may perform Supporting Actions.
Supporting Actions: Whenever a Parent Unit is the target of a charge, or successfully declare a charge, a Support Unit within 6" of the Parent Unit may perform one of the following actions:
1. The Support Unit may Stand and Shoot as if it were the target of the charge, applying all usual restrictions for a Stand and Shoot reaction.
2. The Support Unit may declare a Charge upon an enemy unit which has successfully Charged a Parent Unit, applying all usual restrictions for Charging. This counter-charge is completed during your opponent's turn, after all charge movements have been finalized, but before the Compulsory Movement Sub-phase.
3. The Support Unit may declare a charge against the same unit that the Parent Unit has declared a charge against. At the end of the round of combat, when calculating the Combat Resolution, both units may combine their rank bonus (following all normal restrictions), up to maximum of +6.

Orders
Lord-level Characters with this special rule may give a single Order to a friendly Parent or Support Unit within a 6", whilst Hero-level Characters may only give a single Order to a Parent or Support Unit it has joined. Orders are given at
the start of each friendly player turn. Each order has the following effect:
On The Double!: The target unit gains +2 Movement but cannot declare a charge this turn.
Steady Men!: The target unit may roll an additional D6 when taking Leadership Tests and discard the highest roll. A unit that receives this Order and passes a Rally test may act in the same turn but counts as having moved, which means the unit receives a shooting penalty, cannot March and cannot declare charges.
Ready! Aim! Fire!: The target unit gains +1 to hit with shooting attacks
Brace For Impact!: The target unit gains Fight In Extra Rank but cannot declare charges
The effect of Orders applies immediately to the target unit and lasts one turn. A unit cannot receive the same order more than once during the same turn.
