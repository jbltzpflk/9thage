Army Wide Rules
Hewn out of Mountains: Dwarven Hold armies always count as having a Wizard's Apprentice for the purpose of dispelling.
Ancient Grudge: Dwarven Hold armies have a number of Ancient Grudges which confers certain bonuses when attacking specific enemies. The total amount of Grudges held by a Dwarven Hold army is calculated in the following manner:
- One Grudge for each Dwarf King in the army;
- Additional D3 Grudges for each Dwarf King mounted on the Throne of War;
- One Additional Grudge when facing opponents who field units from the army books Orcs and Goblins or The Vermin Swarm.
For each Grudge held by a Dwarven Hold army, the Player may choose one enemy model or unit to be the target of the Grudge. This choice is made after the Deployment Phase. All models in the Dwarven Hold army have Hatred against a begrudged enemy. If a Dwarven Hold unit already had Hatred it may also reroll failed to-wound rolls against the enemy in every first Round of combat.
When an enemy unit is begrudged, any model which joins that unit also become subject to the Grudge for as long as it remains a part of the unit. However if a single model is begrudged and it joins a unit, the entire unit does not become subject to the grudge. No enemy unit may be targeted more than once by this rule.

Special Rules
Relentless: A model with this rule may march as normal even when within 8" of enemy units. Infantry models may march triple their Movement if they are farther than 8" away from enemy units at the start of their Movement Phase. A unit may only perform these moves if it consists entirely of models with this rule.
Sturdy: A model with this rule gains Thunderous Charge. The model does not suffer -1 to hit when taking a Stand and Shoot charge reaction.
Shield Wall: A model with this rule adds an additional+1 to its Armour Save in Close Combat when using a shield against non-special Close Combat Attacks from enemies to the model's front.
Entrench: Once deployment has finished but before moving Vanguards and Scouts, a model with this rule may entrench one War Machine. The War Machine counts as if in Hard Cover (but loses this rule permanently if it moves).
Holdstone: At the start of any Round of Combat, a model carrying the Holdstone may declare that it is using it. Once it does, the model's unit treat flanks and rear as front for the purposes of Parry, Shieldwall and Supporting Attacks (to their flanks/rear). The unit may still be Disrupted as normal. While the Holdstone is active, the bearer must always issue and accept challenges. The unit cannot pursue any enemies in the same combat that the Holdstone was used. Once the combat is over or the bearer slain, the beneficial effects of the Holdstone immediately end.
Yer comin' with me!: Close Combat Attacks from models with this rule always successfully wound on to-wound rolls of 4+ (or better if the model's Strength would allow it). Any model with this rule that is removed as a casualty in Close Combat may immediately make a Close Combat Attack with the weapon choice for this Combat Round. This attack must be allocated either towards the model that caused the casualty, or its unit (in that case, distributing the hits as shooting) applying all special rules and bonuses. It may however never exceed one attack.
