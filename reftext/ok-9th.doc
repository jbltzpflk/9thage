Do What You're Told: All Slave Giants may reroll on the Giant Attacks table, but must accept the second result.
Giant Attacks: When a giant attacks in Close Combat, pick a target in base contact to attack and roll on the chart below. Giants have two types of attack patterns depending on the Troop Type of the target.
Against Infantry, War Beast, Swarm, Warmachine and Cavalry targets:
1: Bellow
2: Jump
3: Grab
4-6: Swing
Against Monstrous Beast, Monstrous Infantry, Monstrous Cavalry, Chariot, Monster and Ridden Monster targets:
1: Bellow
2-3: Thump
4-6: Smash
Bellow: Neither the giant nor the chosen unit can make any Close Combat attacks this phase. Attacks already done (including those simultaneous with this attack) are not affected. The Giant's side automatically wins the combat by 2. If two (or more) opposing Giants "Bellow", the combat is a draw.
Jump: The chosen unit suffers D6 hits with the Giant's Strength, carried out as if it were a Grinding Attack. The Giant must take a Dangerous Terrain test.
Grab: Select a single model in base contact with the Giant. This model must take a Strength and a Weapon Skill test. For each failed test, the model suffers a hit with the Giant's Strength and Multiple Wounds (D3).
Swing: The Giant makes 2D6 attacks on the chosen unit.
Thump: Select a model from the chosen unit in base contact with the Giant. This model takes a Initiative test. If the test is failed, the model suffers 2D6 wounds with Armour Piercing (6).
Smash: Select a model from the chosen unit in base contact with the Giant. This model suffers 1 wound with Armour Piercing (6). If the model has not yet attacked it cannot attack in this round. It the model has already attacked, it cannot attack in the next player turn.
- Notes Giant Attacks count as Close Combat attacks and are therefore affected by all rules normally affecting Close Combat attacks. After rolling on this chart, the Giant may still Stomp as normal.
