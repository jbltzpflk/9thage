The 9th Age
Daemon Legions Army Rules Version 0.11.1 Beta

Fantasy Battles: The 9th Age is a community-made miniatures wargame.  All relevant rules, as well as feedback and suggestions, can be found/given here: http://www.the-ninth-age.com/ 

Daemonic Army Rules
Mark Restrictions: In addition to the normal army restrictions, units with a Daemonic Mark other than True Chaos are subject to the following additional rules:
Duplicate Limit (in Warband) (in Grand Army)
Core max 2 max 1 max 4
Special max 2 max 1 max 4
Rare max 1 max 1 max 2
These restrictions are lifted for units that share the same Mark as their general. Armies lead by True Chaos Mark Generals are not subject to these restrictions.
Monotheist Army Bonus: If all units in the army have the same Daemonic Mark, the following bonuses apply.
* All Core units and Harbinger characters gain their Mark's Minor Aspect for free.
* All Standard Bearers with Daemonic Mark: Wrath add +1 to channel attempts in the opponent's magic phase.
Standards with the Mark of Wrath count as a Wizard Apprentice for dispelling purposes.
* Many Special and Rare units may now be upgraded with their Mark's Minor Aspect.

Army Special Rules
Daemonic Marks: Models in a Daemon Legion army may bear certain unholy marks that denote their allegiance. Certain models may freely choose their Marks and other models may come with a Mark by default. All models in a unit share the same Mark and characters may only join units that bear their Mark. The Daemonic Mark confers the following properties:
Change The bearer may gain one of the following bonus effects: Flaming Attacks, Divine Attacks or Hellfire, which affects both close combat attacks and shooting attacks. The effect must be chosen at the start of each combat phase and before shooting with a unit. Every model in a unit must choose the same bonus effect. Special Attacks such as Stomps or Impact Hits are not affected. Characters with the Daemonic Mark (Change) that are Wizards do not get the above effect, instead they add a +1 modifier to their casting roll.
Lust The bearer gains Armour Piercing (1), or may increase its existing Armour Piercing by 1.
Pestilence Enemy units in base contact with these models receive a -1 modifier to their Weapon Skill when they attack. This is increased to a -2 modifier to their Weapon Skill if the model attacking is in a unit in base contact with two or more units with the Daemonic Mark (Pestilence). This cannot reduce Weapon Skill below 1.
Wrath The bearer gains +1 Strength during first round of combat. Special Attacks such as Stomps or Impact Hits are not affected.
True Chaos No additional effects.
Daemonic Instability: In addition to the normal Daemonic Instability special rule, units may only benefit from Hold Your Ground and Inspiring Presence granted by a model with the same Daemonic Mark as themselves, or by models with the Daemonic Mark (True Chaos).
Elusive: Units with this rule may declare a Flee charge reaction despite being Immune to Psychology. This ability cannot be used if the unit is joined by a character who does not share this rule.
Trail of Mucus: Enemy units cannot claim Flank or Rear combat resolution bonuses against a unit containing models with this special rule.

Aspects
Units which bear a Daemonic Mark other than True Chaos may receive additional bonuses called Aspects. Characters who benefit from an Aspect grant their effects to any units they join. Therefore, every model in a unit share the same Aspects at any given moment. The model may only take Aspects corresponding to its' own mark.

Mark of Change
Far Seeing (- / 15 pts) - Minor Aspect: The model gains an additional 6" range on all shooting attacks that use Ballistic Skill.

Mark of Lust
Clawed Caress (15 pts) - Minor Aspect: The model gains Armour Piercing (1), which is cumulative with other Armour Piercing values.
Dance of Death (35 / 40 pts )- Supreme Aspect: The model gains Lightning Reflexes.

Mark of Pestilence

Mark of Wrath
Onslaught  (10 / 15 pts) - Minor Aspect: The model gains Devastating Charge.
Eternal Fury (30 / 40 pts) - Supreme Aspect: The model gains Hatred.

Daemonic Items
Daemon Legion armies possess their own version Magical Items called Daemonic Items. Daemonic Items follow the same core rules as Magical Items with the exception that items restricted to the bearers of certain Marks may be repeated within an army. As an exception, Magical Standards may be taken from the pool of Common Magical Items in the Core Rulebook. Any other other Magical Items in a Daemon Legion army must be taken from the list below.

Mortal Blade (40 / 30 pts): Type: Hand Weapon. Attacks made with this weapon have Multiple Wounds (2).
Soul Drinker (50 / 25 pts): Soul Harvest Type: Hand Weapon. When the bearer has caused 6 or more unsaved wounds with this weapon (excluding Breath Weapon wounds), it gains a Breath Weapon (Strength 4). Use of this Breath Weapon resets the wounds counter and the process can start again.  Each Breath Weapon gained this way is a separate one, so it can be used more than once per battle.

Aether Wand (40/ 15 pts ) - Mark of Change Only: Type: Hand Weapon. Every time the bearer successfully casts or dispels a spell, roll a D6. On a 5+ the bearer gains a counter.

Daemonic Arcane Items: Mirror of Change (40 pts) - Mark of Change  only At the start of the Player's Magical Phase, the bearer may pick an enemy wizard within Line of Sight and within 30". For the duration of this Magical Phase the bearer may cast spells known by the selected wizard instead of its own. If the target wizards knows more spells than the bearer is able to learn due to its magical level then the bearer cannot copy all of them and must randomize which spells are mirrored.

Seventh Seal  (35 pts): One Use Only. Instead of making a Dispel attempt, you
may use this item. The spell is automatically dispelled.
