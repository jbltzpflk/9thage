Army Special Rules
Relentless
Units containing only models with this rule may march even when there are enemies within 8”. If an infantry unit that
contains only models with this special rule starts their move more than 8” from an enemy unit it may triple its
movement when marching instead of doubling it.
Sturdy
A model with this rule gets Thunderous Charge special rule. Furthermore it does not suffer -1 to hit when taking a
Stand and Shoot charge reaction.
Chosen of Ashuruk
Models with this rule will automatically pass all Fear tests (but still suffer -1Ld from Fear). Models with this rule
consider all units, without this rule, to have the Insignificant special rule and will not use their Engineer rule on models
without Chosen of Ashuruk rule.
Daemonic Infusion
The war machine gets Magical Attacks rule (not applicable to crew), and any Panic Test caused to enemy units is taken
with a -1 Leadership modifier.
Volcanic Embrace
All attacks made by a model with this Special Rule (even Special Attacks) are Flaming Attacks. In addition enemy
models in base contact with one or more models with this rule suffer a Strength 4 hit at the start of each Combat Phase.
Shackles Of Fire
When rolling To Wound against a model with this rule, any natural roll of '6' must be re-rolled, Magical Attacks are not
affected by this.
At the start of its second and any subsequent turn, the unit must take a Leadership Test. If failed it suffers a Wound with
no save possible, furthermore if there are no friendly wizards in the army, the wound is taken with the Multiple
Wounds(D3) rule.
Unruly
Unruly units have -1 Ld to rolls on following tests: Restrain Frenzy, Restrain Pursuit. In addition, if in horde formation
roll 3 dice for panic tests and discard the highest.
Opportunist
When fighting an enemy unit in the flank or rear, models on foot in a unit with this special rule gain +1 to hit as long as
their unit isn’t attacked in the flank or rear.

Giant Attacks:​ When a giant attacks in Close Combat, pick a target in base contact to attack and roll on the chart

Against Monstrous Beast, Monstrous Infantry,
Monstrous Cavalry, Chariot, Monster and Ridden
Monster targets:
1​ : Bellow
2-3:​ Thump
4-6:​ Smash
Bellow​ : Neither the giant nor the chosen unit can make any Close Combat attacks this phase. Attacks already done
(including those simultaneous with this attack) are not affected. The Giant's side automatically wins the combat by 2.
If two (or more) opposing Giants “Bellow”, the combat is a draw.
Jump:​ The chosen unit suffers D6 hits with the Giant's Strength, carried out as if it were a Grinding Attack. The Giant
must take a Dangerous Terrain test.
Grab:​ Select a single model in base contact with the Giant. This model must take a Strength and Weapon Skill test. For
each failed test, the model suffers a hit with the Giant's Strength and Multiple Wounds (D3).
Swing:​ The Giant makes 2D6 attacks on the chosen unit.
Thump:​ Select a model from the chosen unit in base contact with the Giant. This model takes a Initiative test. If the
test is failed, the model suffers 2D6 wounds with Armour Piercing (6).
Smash:​ Select a model from the chosen unit in base contact with the Giant. This model suffers 1 wound with Armour
Piercing (6). If the model has not yet attacked it cannot attack in this round. It the model has already attacked, it
cannot attack in the next player turn.
- NotesGiant Attacks counts as Close Combat attack and therefore are affected by all rules normally affecting Close Combat
attacks. After rolling on this chart, the Giant may still Stomp as normal.
