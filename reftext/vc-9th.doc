Fantasy Battles
The 9th Age
Vampire Covenant Army Rules Version 0.11.0 Beta

Fantasy Battles: The 9th Age is a community-made miniatures wargame. All relevant rules, as well as feedback and suggestions, can be found/given here: http://www.the-ninth-age.com/

Army Special Rules
Master of Undeath
Only Models with this Special Rule can be chosen as General. The General is automatically designated as Master and
must exchange one spell for Invocation of the Undead, regardless of which Path it uses.
Ashes to Ashes
At the end of any phase in which the Master is removed as a casualty, every unit in the army with one or more models
with Ashes to Ashes must pass a Leadership test or suffer an amount of wounds with no saves of any kind allowed equal
to the amount by which the test was failed. These wounds are distributed following the rules for Unstable except they
can never be distributed to models that do not have Ashes to Ashes. This is reduced by one wound if the unit received
Hold Your Ground.
At the beginning of your next Player's Turn following the death of the Master, a new Master may be selected. In order to
do so, the Player must nominate another eligible character who is a Wizard using the Path of Necromancy. This
character is your new Master. If the army does not have any eligible character, every unit with the Ashes to Ashes rule
must once again pass a Leadership test or suffer wounds as described above. This effect will repeat itself at the start of
each of the owning Player's turn until the game ends.
Chilling Shriek (X, Y)
Part of a model with this Special Rule may perform a shooting special attack with range 8". It can be used after
marching and hits automatically. The target suffers X hits with strength equal to Y plus the current number of Wounds
of the shooting part of model, where X and Y are the number within the brackets. When rolling to wound, compare the
Strength with the target's Leadership instead of Toughness. Wounds caused are Armour Piercing (6) and Magical
Attacks. In the combat phase the model may replace its normal attacks to instead scream at one unit that it is in base
contact with it.
Awaken (X)
Models with this special rule can Raise wounds of all the units stated within the brackets above their starting size, using
any effect that Raises wounds. A unit's starting size is the size they are written as in the army list. Units can be increased
even beyond the maximum size written in their unit entry using this rule.
Reaper
Units consisting solely of models with this special rule may move through enemy units during the Remaining Moves
Sub-Phase. All Models in such units can make a single Close Combat attack against a single unengaged enemy unit which
has been moved through. These attacks hit automatically and are distributed towards the unit as a whole.
2
Vampiric (X)
Models with this Special Rule can make march moves as normal even when outside the range of the General's Inspiring
Presence. They still have to test Leadership if they are within 8" of enemy units.
At the end of the close combat phase, units with this Special Rule can make a single Vampiric Roll if a Model part with
this Special Rule cased least one wound during the phase. Roll a D6 for each Vampiric Roll, X+ a single wound is Raised
to the unit, where X is the number stated within the brackets (a 1 is always a failure). Characters must cause wounds
and roll for Raised wounds separately from any unit they are joined to.
Wake the Dead
Each time after an Augment spell from Path of Necromancy (including the Curse of Undeath) is resolved against a unit
containing at least one model with this rule, you may select a single unit within 6" of it. Until the end of the following
player turn, all Models in the chosen units have the Lightning Reflexes special rule.
Necromantic Aura
All friendly units within 6" of one or models with this Special Rule reduce the number of wounds caused by Ashes to
Ashes and Unstable by 1. Models with the Necromantic Aura cannot benefit themselves from Necromantic Aura.
3
Vampiric Bloodlines
Vampire Counts and Vampire Courtiers may purchase unique upgrades called Blood Powers, separated in two
categories called Bloodline Powers and Ancient Blood Powers. Vampires may also be upgraded to become part of a
Bloodline, granting them additional bonuses and sometimes restrictions. The Vampire Counts and Vampire Courtiers of
an army must either belong to the same Bloodline or none at all.
Bloodline Vampires
May only purchase powers that are specific to that
Bloodline. Ancient Blood Powers may only be taken by
Vampire Counts. Bloodline powers can be duplicated,
Ancient Blood Powers are One of a Kind.
Independent Vampires
A Vampire that is not part of a Bloodline may choose
between non Ancient Blood Powers of all the Bloodlines.
All Bloodline powers are One of a Kind.
Blood Ties (X): Certain unit entries in this army book bear the mention Blood Ties, followed by the name of a Bloodline
between brackets. If the Bloodline of the Vampire characters in the army matches the one written within the Brackets,
you gain access to the upgrade written in this rule on the unit entry.
