Kingdom of Equitaine Army Rules Version 0.11.0 Beta

Army Special Rules
TheBlessing: Models with this Special Rule have Ward Save (6+). After all units are deployed, the player may declare that the Kingdom of Equitaine army is praying before battle, which automatically concedes to the opponent the right to decide who wins the roll for first turn. If an army has prayed, the Ward Save granted by The Blessing is increased to (5+) against attacks with Strength 5 or greater. The effect of The Blessing is lost for any model that flees.
LanceFormation: This Special Rule can only be used when mounted. The model gains Fight in Extra Rank. When in a unit with 3 model wide ranks and charging, models with this rule gain an additional instance of Fight in Extra Rank.
Jousting: Models with this rule may switch to another weapon in the second round of combat after charging with a Lance.
Trample: The model gains Stomp (1) in any turn during which it doesn't count as having charged. Only the mount can use this attack.
Beloved: The model ignores all penalties for refusing a challenge and loses First in Rank when joined to a unit with at least one Full Rank of models with the Lance Formation.
OathOfFealty: Models with this Special Rule have Inspiring Presence regardless of whether they are the General or not. However, only models with the Insignificant Special Rule may receive this Inspiring Presence and its range is reduced to 6". Characters and Champions with this rule causes their unit to lose The Blessing if they decline any challenge.
QuestingOath: Models with this Special Rule have WeaponMasters and Multiple Wounds (2, Monstrous Beasts, Monstrous Cavalry, Ridden Monsters, Monsters). When taking a Panic or a Fear test, units comprised of a
majority of models with this rule roll 3D6 for their Leadership tests and discard the highest. The models may not wield lances. Characters with this special rule are equipped with a Bastard Sword (counts as a Halberd).
Grail Oath: Models with this Special Rule are Immune to Psychology, have a Ward Save (5+) and their attacks are Magical Attacks and Holy Attacks. Characters with this special rule get +1 weapon skill and Leadership 9.
