Army Special Rules
Safety in Numbers
Non-fleeing units comprised solely of models with this Special Rule add their number of Full Ranks after the first one to
their Leadership (up to maximum of +3). This rule cannot be used to modify the Leadership that is distributed by
models with Inspiring Presence (but the received Inspiring Presence can be modified by Safety in Numbers).
Furthermore if all models in a unit have this Special Rule, they add +1 to any flee distances they roll.
Callous
A model with this special rule is allowed to use non-template shooting weapons against an enemy unit in close combat
with friendly units of Infantry, or Swarms, not containing any characters. When firing at an enemy unit in close combat
with friendly units, roll to hit as normal and then randomize each hit scored. On a 4+ it hits the target, otherwise it hits a
fr
iendly unit in that combat (randomize if several friendly units are involved in the combat).
Honourless
Characters that are Honourless do not receive the usual penalties from refusing a challenge.
State of Trance (X)
The war platform and the unit it has joined gains the Immune To Psychology special rule. The war platform may only
join units of (x). Disregard other characters.
Greater Clan
Plague Cult
Toxic attacks have -1 to wound against models with this rule.
Volatile
When a model with this rule rolls a misfire, roll a D6 and consult the table below.
1 (or less) Explosion!
No shots are fired. Scatter the model D6". If it hits any unit in its path the unit takes D6 Strength 5
hits. Remove the model.
2-3 Malfunction
No shots are fired. The model suffers a Wound with no Saves of any kind allowed.
4-5 Overcharged
Pivot the unit towards a random direction and then resolve the shooting attack as normal against
the first unit within line of sight and range, straight in front of the shooting model. Replace
Lightning Cannon's and Dreadmill's normal shooting with a Line Template (6D6"). Models hit take
a Strength 10 hit with Magical Attacks, Lightning Attacks and Armour Piercing (6).
6+ Spent
The shooting is resolved as normal (a Dreadmill will fire 3 shots). The Warp Weapon is then
considered broken and can't be used anymore for the rest of the game. If the model is a Warp
Weapon Team, remove it as casualty instead.
