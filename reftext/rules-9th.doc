Fantasy Battles
The 9th Age
Rulebook Version 0.11.9.3 Beta

Introduction
What is Fantasy Battles: The 9th Age?
Fantasy Battles: The 9th Age, often simply called The 9th Age, is a community-made miniatures wargame in which two
grand armies clash in an epic battle for power or survival. Each army can be composed of simple foot soldiers, skilled
archers, armour-clad mounted knights, powerful wizards, legendary heroes, epic monsters, huge dragons, and more.
The game takes place on a 4 by 6 foot battlefield and uses six-sided dice to resolve different actions such as charging
into battle, letting arrows loose, or casting spells.
All relevant rules, as well as feedback and suggestions, can be found/given here:
http://www.the-ninth-age.com/
To make the transition easier for veteran players, we have colour-coded the most relevant changes (from 8th edition) in
blue.
Rules Changes between versions (not from alpha version) are colour-coded in green (see change log at the end of the
document).

The Scale of the Game
Playing tabletop war games is often an exercise in abstract thought, especially when it comes to mass battle games like
The 9th Age. As such there is no prescribed scale while playing The 9th Age; a single miniature could represent a single,
a dozen or even a hundred warriors. Though players are welcome to interpret the scale as they like, the distances used
in the rules do not seem realistic if the scale of 1:1 compared to the actual size of the miniatures is used for the game.
The scale of miniatures used for The 9th Age is roughly 1:72 when compared to real-life sized equivalents. Based on
that, 1" in the game would be roughly equal to 1.5 meters in real life. An average human-like creature in the game has a
movement value of 4" which means that in a single movement phase it would move only 6 meters (12 if marching).
Likewise a ranged weapon like a longbow has an effective range of 30" in the game which would equal roughly 45
meters, which is 5 times shorter than the average historic effective range of the weapon of around 250 meters.
For example, players could use the historic range of the longbow to determine what kind of distance 1" represents in a
game. In that case 1" would be slightly more than 8 meters and be much closer to representing the distances assumed
when writing the rules for this game.
Just as we can imagine that the combatants in the game are actually smaller than the miniatures that represent them, so
we can imagine that a single miniature does not necessarily represent a single warrior. Being abstract we could imagine
a unit of 10 elite elven warriors representing exactly 10 elves, or some other group size like 20, 50 or 100. At the same
time a unit of 10 weedy goblin runts could just represent 10 goblins, but is more likely to represent some larger group
like 100, 200 or 500 of the little creatures. At this point one may ask about characters and monsters. These models are
meant to represent exceptional individuals and especially potent creatures that are worth entire regiments on their
own. If it is easier to come to terms with, a miniature of a character could represent not just the character itself but also
his bodyguards and assorted staff that might follow such a hero to battle.
In the same vein, the pieces of terrain could be viewed to represent exactly what they are, but they could also be visual
representations of far greater things for the purpose of the game. So a copse of trees could represent a forest, a stream
could actually be a wide river, a single house could be in place of a hamlet, while a tower could represent a keep.
As for the timescale of the game we believe it is even more arbitrary than the size scale of the game. The action of
moving in the movement phase could take several minutes of real time while casting spells in the magic phase or
shooting in the shooting phase could be near instantaneous events. Likewise the actions of the two units clashing in the
close combat phase could represent only a few heart beats in real time, while a challenge between two mighty
individuals could be a drawn combat, lasting minutes or more. Therefore no quantitative value can be assigned to a
game turn or turn sub-phase.
We are not here to tell players how to imagine their fights or how many individuals each miniature should represent,
but we believe that an easy equation of 1" being roughly equal to 10 meters is a good representation of the size of the
game we are creating. An average game will be played on a 72"x48" table, and thus represents a real-life area of 720 by
480 meters or roughly 50 football pitches. In medieval times (the closest thing we have to our fantasy world) this would
represent an average sized battlefield where two forces with soldiers numbering from a few hundred to several
thousand would meet.

Setting up a Game
Building an Army
Fantasy Battles: The 9th Age includes a series of Army Books which contain descriptions of the different armies. Each
army has unique characters, troops and rules. Characters are divided into Lords and Heroes. Troops are divided into
Core, Special and Rare.
Lords are the most powerful
individuals in the army.
Heroes are exceptional individuals in
the army.
Core units represent regiments of
most common warriors in the army.
Special units are veteran and elite
regiments.
Rare units represent extraordinary
troops, uncommon monsters and
unusual war machines.
The first step to building an army is to write down a selection of units, options and their point costs on a document,
called the "army list". The exact composition of an army is subject to certain rules and restrictions which the following
chapter will describe in detail.
8
Army Restrictions
An army in Fantasy Battles: The 9th Age is subject to basic composition rules:
* Army Points
The combined points value of every unit in the army, including options and equipment, must not exceed the
determined point limit for the battle. An army may fall below the limit only by 20 points or less.
* Unit Categories
All units are separated into five categories. The number of points one can spend on these categories differs.
Additionally the same unit can only be taken a limited number of times.
Point limit Duplicate limit
Core at least 25% max 4
Special - max 3
Rare max 25% max 2
Heroes max 50% max 3
Lords max 35% max 3
Heroes + Lords max 50% -
* Minimum Army Size
Every army must contain a minimum of 4 units excluding the Characters. For this purpose, all units with the
War Machine Troop Type count together as one.
* The General
One Character in the army must be named the General. Therefore there must be at least one Hero or Lord
included in the army who is eligible to fulfil this role. An Army can only have one General.
* One of a Kind and One per Army
Units, upgrades and items marked as "One of a Kind" and "One per Army" may only be taken once per army.
"One of a Kind" can be taken twice per Grand Army.
9
Warbands and Grand Armies
The rules for army composition are modified depending on the size of an army. An army that is unusually small or
unusually large is subject to the following rules.
Warbands
Armies of 1500 points or less are called
Warbands. The minimum army size is decreased
to 3 units.
Warband duplicate limit
Core max 2
Special max 2
Rare max 1
Heroes & Lords max 2
One of a Kind max 1
One per Army max 1
Grand Armies
Armies of 4000 points and more are called
Grand Armies. Units which are marked as One
of a Kind can be taken up to 2 times.
Grand Army duplicate limit
Core max 8
Special max 6
Rare max 4
Heroes & Lords max 6
One of a Kind max 2
One per Army max 1

Hidden or Open Lists ?
Rules are written and balanced based on the principle of openness, i.e.youropponentknowswhatMagicalItemsyour
models are equipped with. We encourage players to share their full army lists with their opponents at thestartofthe
game. This army list should include all units, unit options, Magical Items, special abilities, point costs and so on. The
only things that arenotopentoyouropponentarethingsthatareexplicitlystatedashiddenorsecret(suchasinwhich

Hidden Lists
Someplayersmayprefertouseso-calledhiddenlists.Forsuchplayers,weincludethehiddenlistrules.Pleasenotethat
the game is not balanced with these rules in mind. In this format,mostofyourarmyrosterwillbeopen(meaningthat
your opponent should know whatyourarmyconsistsofbeforethegamestarts).However,somepartsofyourarmyare
secret or "hidden". Both players should provide their opponent with the open part of their army (a "mundane army
list") before the game begins.
The following is included in the hidden part of your army.
1. Magical Items that are picked from the common list of Magical Items.
2. Magical Items that are specific to Army Books, as well as any option that follows the rules for Magical Items
such as Daemonic Items and Dwarven Runes.

player must be able to tell the units apart in the hidden list. For example if a player fields two units identicalinevery

Magical Standard has a red banner while the unit with a blue banner possesses no such Magical Item.
Revealing Magical Items
A Magical Item (orsimilar)mustberevealedthefirsttimeitisused.Anitemisconsideredbeingusedwhenitaffectsor
could affect the game in any way. For example:
- It affects a dice roll (even if the actual result of the dice has no effect).
- It alters an attack (such as a Magical Weapon, or any item with a special rule that affects an attack).
- It alters a saving throw (reveal the item before rolling the saving throw). Note that an item that affects the save the
same way as the mundane counterpart would (such as many magical shields) does not need to be revealed.
An item that increases movement only counts as being used if the unit moves further than it couldwithoutitorwhen
charging (declare that you have the item before rolling the charge distance but after reactions are taken). When
revealing Dwarven Runic Items, only reveal the rune that is being used, not the entire combined item.

The Pre-Game Sequence
There are several steps that players must go through in order to set up a game of Fantasy Battles: The 9th Age. These
steps are referred to as the pre-game sequence. The first and foremost step is to find a suitable opponent and agree on
the size of the game. The players may then share their army lists and begin building the Battlefield, followed by picking
the deployment type, choosing the Secondary Objectives of the game, determining Deployment Zones and generating
Wizard spells. The last step will consist of going through what is called the Deployment.
Before the game can begin, some preparations have to be made.
1 Decide on Game Size.
2 Share Army List with Opponent.
3 Build the Battlefield.
4 Pick Deployment Type.
5 Choose Secondary Objectives.
6 Determine Deployment Zones.
7 Generate Spells.
8 Deployment Phase.
The Size of the Game
In Fantasy Battles: The 9th Age, two armies opposing each other on the battlefield must have roughly the same point
cost. This ensures that the battle will be decided through the clever strategies and tactics of the players rather than by
an unfair difference in army size. The first step to setting up a game is to agree on the total point cost of the army that
each player will bring. This pre-determined point cost will henceforth correspond to the size of the game. Armies are
typically worth between 500 and 1000 points for small engagements, between 1000 and 2000 points for serious battles
and beyond 2000 points for mighty clashes between epic armies.
Sharing Army Lists
After deciding the size of the game, the next step is for both players to swap Army Lists and share all relevant
information about the upcoming game. Alternatively, the players may agree to keep certain aspects about their armies
secret, which they will progressively reveal during the course of the game. For more information please see the section
on Hidden Lists.
12
Building the Battlefield
A game of Fantasy Battles: The9thAgeisplayedonaboardthatis72"wideand48"deep.Forsmallerbattlesinvolving
Warbands, it is recommended to use a board that is 36" wide and 48" deep, while for bigger games involving Grand
Armies it is recommended to adjust the size depending onthesizeofthearmies.Whilesomebattlesmaytakeplaceon
a completely flat board, a Battlefield typically has Terrain Features placed upon it. The players canfreelyagreeonthe
size, type and number of Terrain Features to be placed, as well as their positions. If an agreement cannot be reached,
the game provides the following default rules for setting up a randomly generated Battlefield.
* First, divide the gaming board into 24" x 24" sections.
* Place the following Terrain Features in the centre of a randomly selected section (max 1 piece in each section):
One Building or Impassable Terrain (randomly decide which of the two), one Hill, and one Forest. Then move
each Terrain piece 2D6" in a random direction.
* Next, add 2D3 additional pieces of Terrain following the rules above to determine their position. Roll a D6 and
consult the table below to determine the type of each additional Terrain Feature.
1: Hill 2: Forest 3: Field 4: Water 5: Wall 6: Ruin
* All Terrain Features must be placed at least 6" away from each other. You may move the pieces as little as
possible from their rolled position in order to meet this criterion. If it is not possible to place the Terrain piece
more than 6" away from any other Terrain then discard the problematic piece.
* Recommended Terrain piece sizes are between 6" x 8" and 6" x 10" except for Walls which are 1" x 10".
13
Deployment Type
Players may agree on which deployment type to use or may want to randomize this variable by rolling a D6 and
consulting the following table.
1-3: Classic
The Table is divided into two
halves by the straight line through
the centre of the board, parallel to
the table's long edges.
Deployment Zones are areas more
than 12" away from this line.
4-5: Diagonal
The Table is divided into two
halves by a diagonal line across
the table. Whoever gets to choose
the Deployment Zone decides
which diagonal to use.
Deployment Zones are areas more
than 9" away from this line.
6: Flank Attack
The Table is divided into two halves by
drawing a straight line through the
centre of the board, parallel to the
table's long edges. The player who gets
to choose the Deployment Zone
decides if they want to be the attacker
or the defender. The attacker may
deploy more than 9" from the central
line if within ¼ of the table's length
fr
om either table edge (18" on a 72"
table), and more than 15" from the
central line elsewhere. The defender
does the opposite: more than 15" away
fr
om the central line if within ¼ of the
table's length from the table's short
edges, and more than 9" away from the
central line elsewhere.

ualisation of the three different deployment types.
14
Secondary Objectives
Both players may agree on which Secondary Objective to use, or they can randomly choose by rolling a D6 and
consulting the table below. See section Scoring and Victory Conditions for more details on the impact of Secondary
Objectives at the end of the game.
1-2: Hold the Ground 3-4: Breakthrough 5-6: Secure Target
Deployment Zones
In a Classic deployment type the players must pick one of the long board edges as their Deployment Zone, while in a
Diagonal deployment type, the players must pick one of the corners. In a Flank Attack deployment type the players
must decide who is the attacker or defender. The players may agree on which Deployment Zones to use or alternatively
may decide to randomize this decision. For example, a player may roll a D6 and get to choose on a 4+.
Generating Spells
Starting with the player that picked their Deployment Zone, each player must now generate spells for all their Wizards.
To do this, pick a Wizard and consult the chosen Path of Magic (the Path used by the Wizard must be noted on the army
list). All Magic Paths can be found in Fantasy Battles: The 9th Age: Paths of Magic. All Paths contain spells numbered 0
through 6. Roll a D6 for each spell the Wizard has (normally the same number as its Wizard Level) to see which spells
the Wizard can use in this battle. If a '1' is rolled, the Wizard knows the spell number 1, and so on. If a duplicate spell is
rolled (either because another Wizard in the same army has already rolled the spell or because the same Wizard rolled
a double), the Wizard must replace the duplicate result with a freely chosen other spell from the same Path that has not
already been rolled. Two Wizards in the same army cannot know the same spell, and no Wizard can know a single spell
more than once (if you are unable to replace the duplicate spell with an unoccupied spell, the spell is lost). The Wizard
may always exchange one of its spells for the signature spell of that Magic Path (labelled as spell number 0). This spell
can be chosen even if other Wizards already have that spell.
Spells that are not generated using these rules (such as spells belonging to Wizards with predetermined spells, or any
Bound Spells) are ignored for the purpose of duplicated spells. A player can have more than one such spell in the army.

Deployment Phase
Deployment Phase Sequence
1 Determine who deploys first.
2 Take turns deploying units.
3 Determine who takes the first turn.
4 Deploy remaining units.
5 Deploy Scout units.
6 Move Vanguard units.
7 Other rules and abilities.
8 Roll for first turn.
Determine Who Deploys First
The player that did not choose the Deployment Zone decides which player deploys first.
Deploy Units
The players then take turns to deploy their units (fully inside their own Deployment Zone). On each of their turns, a
player must deploy at least one unit, but can choose to deploy any number of units. All units with the War Machine
Troop Type count as a single unit during the Deployment Phase. The same goes for all Characters. Once a player has
deployed all of their units (excluding units that are not deployed using the normal rules, such as scouting or ambushing
units), that player must announce if they will roll to play first or second.
Deploy Remaining Units
The remaining player must now deploy the rest of their army. Count how many units are deployed in this step and
remember the value. This value is called the "Undeployed Units Number" and will be used at the end of this sequence.
As before, deploying all remaining War Machines and Characters counts as one unit each.
Other Rules And Abilities
Put into effect all remaining rules and abilities described as taking place right before the battle.
16
Roll For First Turn
Both players must now roll a D6. The player that finished deploying first adds the "Undeployed Units Number" score to
their dice roll.
- If the player who finished deploying first gets a higher result, they play first or second as was previously
announced.
- If the score is a tie or the player who finished deploying second wins, they can now choose which player has
the first turn.
17
General Principles
Game Turn
Fantasy Battles: The 9th Age is a turn based game. A standard game lasts for 6 Game Turns. One player has the first turn
(called a Player Turn), in which they use their units to move and attack. After this, the other player has their first Player
Turn. When this comes to an end, Game Turn 1 is completed. In Game Turn 2, the first player now has their second
Player Turn, and so on, until both players have completed 6 Player Turns. This marks the end of the game.
Player Turn
Each Player Turn is divided into four Phases, performed in the following order:
1 Movement Phase
2 Magic Phase
3 Shooting Phase
4 Close Combat Phase
Active and Reactive Player
The Active Player is the player whose turn it currently is.
The Reactive Player is the player whose turn it currently is not.
Simultaneous Abilities
Whenever two or more abilities happen at the same time, the Active Player must declare the usage of their abilities
before the Reactive Player. Once both players have declared the usage of their abilities, the effects of the abilities are
resolved, starting with the Active Player. Each player is free to decide the order of their own simultaneous abilities. For
example, if both players have abilities that may be activated at the beginning of the magic phase, the player whose
magic phase it is must choose first if they are using their abilities or not. Then the Reactive Player can choose if they are
using their abilities or not. After this, the effects of the abilities from both sides are resolved, starting with the Active
Player's abilities.
18
Rolling Dice
In Fantasy Battles: The 9th Age, dice are often used to determine random outcomes. The most commonlyusedtypeis
the six-sided dice, named "D6", with a range from 1 to 6. The effects of a dice roll areoftendependingonwhetherthe
rolled value is equal toorhigherthanasetvalue(suchasadicerollthatissuccessfulifthedicerolls'3'orhigher).This
is often referred to as a "3+" (or 2+, 4+, 6+, etc.). Sometimes, you are calledupontorollmorethanoneofthesediceat
the same time. This is represented by a number before the type of dice rolled, such as "3D6", which means to roll 3
six-sided dice and add the results together. On other occasions, a dice roll may be modifiedbyaddingorsubtractinga
number, such as D6+1. In such cases,simplyaddtherelevantnumbertoorsubtractitfromtheresultoftheroll.Lastly,
some effects in the game call for rerolling certain dice, such as "failed to-wound rolls", or "Ward Save results of '1'".
When you encounter such situations, reroll the relevant dice.
Dice can only be rerolled once . The second result is final, no matter the cause/source or result.
The gamesometimesrequirestorollaD3.ThisisperformedbyrollingaD6andthenhalvingtheresult,roundingup,so
that the result can only end up being 1, 2 or 3. If the game requires a natural '1' or a natural '6' when rolling D3, it
always refers to the value of the D6 before halving.
The Scatter Dice
The Scatter Dice is a special six-sided dicewithtwosidesmarkedwith"Hit"andfoursidesmarkedwithanarrow.This
dice is typically used in a situation where a projectile or spell effect comes with a risk of deviating in a random direction.
Scatter
When you are called upon to Scatter an object (for example "Scatter a Template
D6""), roll the Scatter Dice. If a "Hit" symbol is rolled, do not move the object. If an
arrow is rolled then roll the specified deviation distance (D6 in this case) and move
the object by that number of inches inthedirectionpointedbytheScatterDice.Note
that this is not the same thing as randomizing a direction.
Representing the Scatter Dice with a standard D6
Alternatively a Scatter Dice can be represented by rolling a standard six-sided dice
and using thesidewithasingledottorepresentthedirectionofanarrowasdepicted
on Figure 2. Rolling a result of '1' or '6' is considereda"Hit"withnodeviation.Since
'1' and '6' are on opposite faces onastandarddice,anyresultotherthan'1'or'6'can
be interpreted as an arrow.
Fig

Tw
o different ways of representing a Scatter Dice.
19
Random Direction
Certain rules may ask the player to determine a random direction. In such cases, roll the Scatter Dice until an arrow is
rolled and then use the direction in which it points. Ignore any "Hit" result; in this special case you are allowed to reroll
an already rerolled dice. Some Scatter Dice feature a small arrow within the "Hit" symbol. If that is the case you do not
need to reroll "Hit" results, simply use the small arrow to determine the direction.
Templates
Templates are used to determine areas of effect. There are several different types and sizes of Templates. The most
commonly used Templates are 3" and 5" Templates. These are disk-shaped Templates with a 3" and 5" diameter
respectively. Other less commonly used Templates include the 1" round Template (called 1" Template) and the Line
Template (used for Cannons and some spells). When determining how many models are beneath (or touched by) the
Template, hold the appropriate Template over the target to see which model bases are directly underneath it. If any
part of a model's base is beneath a Template (however small that part is), that model counts as being under the
Template. Any given point on a Template can only ever be in contact with one base. The model bases are based on the
metric system, while the Template sizes are in inches. This means, for example, that a 3" Template is capable of
touching the bases of 5 lined up models with 25mm bases (3" = 7.62cm).
20
Characteristics
The Characteristics Profile
Each model part has a Characteristics Profile , which contains 9 different Characteristics:
M Movement The movement speed of the model, in inches.
WS Weapon Skill How likely it is for the model to land hits and avoid being hit in close combat.
BS Ballistic Skill How likely it is for the model to land a hit with ranged weapons.
S Strength The higher the strength, the easier it is to wound other models and crush armour.
T Toughness A high toughness allows to withstand blows more easily.
W Wounds When the model loses this many wounds, it is removed as a casualty.
I Initiative Models with a higher initiative strike first.
A Attacks The number of times the model can attack in close combat.
Ld Leadership Shows the model's discipline and ability to stand and fight in life-threatening situations.
All Characteristics have a numeric value between 0 and 10 and can never go outside this range.
Value of 0
When a Characteristic value is 0, it can also be labelled as a dash ("-").
0 Movement The model cannot move.
0 Weapon Skill The model part is automatically hit in Close Combat and can only hit in Close Combat on 6+.
0 Ballistic Skill The model part cannot use Shooting Weapons.
0 Wounds A model with its Wounds reduced to 0 is removed as a casualty.
0 Attacks A model part with an unmodified Attacks of 0 can never make normal Close Combat Attacks.
21
Performing a Characteristic Test
To perform a Characteristic Test, roll a D6. If the result is less or equal than the tested Characteristic, the test is passed.
Otherwise the test is failed. A test always fails on the result of '6'. This means that models that have a Characteristic with
a value of 0 will automatically fail Characteristic Tests targeting that Characteristic.
When a model with more than one value of a Characteristic (such as a dragon and its rider) is called upon to take a
Characteristic Test, take a single test for the combined model, using the highest Characteristic available. When a unit as
a whole takes a Characteristic Test, use the highest value.
Using Unmodified Characteristics
An unmodified Characteristic is the exact value that can be read on a unit profile when ignoring any modification from
equipment, spells and rules. The only exceptions are Characteristic changes made when building the army, such as
upgrading a model to a 'veteran', thereby granting +1 Strength on its profile. Such a modification is considered included
in the model's unmodified Characteristic.
Using Borrowed Characteristics
In certain situations a model may borrow or use the Characteristic of another model. In this case the value of the
borrowed Characteristic is taken after applying any modification from equipment, spells or special rules that the owner
of the Characteristic is subject to. Modification from equipment, spells or special rules that affects the unit will then be
applied to this (following the rules for Priority of Modifiers below).
Performing a Leadership Test
To perform a Leadership Test the player rolls 2D6 and compares the result with the Leadership Characteristic of a
model. If the roll result is equal or less then the Leadership value, the test is passed. Otherwise, the Test is failed. If a
unit takes a Leadership Test and more than one Leadership value is available (for example when a Character joins a
unit), the player must always use the highest value.
There are many different game mechanics that may call for a Leadership Test, such as performing a Panic Test or a
Break Test. All such game mechanics are Leadership Tests, regardless of any additional rules and modifications
described in the relevant sections of the rulebook.
Priority of Modifiers
When Characteristics are modified, the modifiers are applied in a strict order:
1. Characteristics borrowed* or set to certain values (such as Inspiring Presence or a failed Fear Test)
2. Multiplications (such as halved, doubled or multiplied by 2). Unless noted otherwise, always round fractions
up.
3. Addition and Subtraction (such as -1 or +3)
*If the Characteristic to be borrowed is modified, apply these modifiers before borrowing the Characteristic.
If several modifications within the same group are to be applied, apply them chronologically. Remember that
Characteristics can never (not even temporarily) be modified to above 10 or below 0.
22
Battlefield Logistics
Measuring Distances
The measuring unit in Fantasy Battles: The 9th Age, is the inch ("). An inch corresponds to 2.54 cm. All distances and
ranges are indicated and measured in inches. To determine the distance between two points on the Battlefield (or two
units, or any other elements), you must always measure from the closest points, even if the line of measuring goes
through any kind of intervening or obstructing element. Ignore such obstructions for the purposes of measurement.
Players are always allowed to measure any distance at any time .
Line of Sight
A model can trace a Line of Sight to its target (a point or model) if you can extend a straight line from the front of its
base directly to its target, without going outside of the model's front arc, and without being interrupted by Obscuring
Terrain or by the base of a model which has a larger Height than both the unit and its target. Models in back ranks
always draw Line of Sight as if they were in the front rank, in the same file(s) they are in. A unit is considered to have a
Line of Sight to a target if one or more models in the unit has Line of Sight. Models in a unit never block Line of Sight to
other models in the same unit.
Model Height
Models are divided into the following three Heights:
Small
Any model with one of the following Troop Types: Infantry, War Beast, Swarm and War Machine.
Medium
Any model with one of the following Troop Types: Cavalry, Monstrous Infantry, Monstrous Beast, Monstrous Cavalry
and Chariot.
Large
Any model with the special rule Large Target.
23
Unit Spacing
All units must under normal circumstances be separated by at least 1" fromanyotherunits(friendsorfoes)andfrom
Impassable Terrain. A unit may come within ½" of these elements during the course of a move but must be kept 1"
away once the move ends. Certain forms of movement are specifically allowedtobreakthisspacingrule,withthebest
example being a charge which allows a unit to engageenemiesinCloseCombat.Othertypesofmovesmayallowaunit
to come closer than 1" tofriendlyunitsorImpassableTerrainbutonlyachargeallowsdirectcontactwithenemyunits.
If a unit is allowed to temporarily break the spacing rule for one reason or another and then moves away, the rule
automatically begins to apply again.
Board Edge
The board edge represents the boundaries of the game. Models can move temporarily outside the board edge on the
condition that no more than 50% of the model's Footprint is outside the board and as long as the move does not end
with any part of the model outside the board. Templates can be partiallyoutsidetheboardandstillaffectmodelswith
the parts of the Template that are still on the board.
24
Units and Formations
Models
Models represent fighting warriors, monsters and spellcasters. Everything that is standing on the same base is
considered the same model (e.g. a dragon and its rider or a Cannon and its three crewmen are considered a single
model).
Bases and Base Contact
All models are placed on a square, rectangular or round base. The extent of the model is considered to be its base. Base
sizes are given as two measurements in millimetres: front-width x side-length. (For example, the normal cavalry base is
25x50mm). In some rare cases models have round bases. In these cases, only as single measurement is given: the
diameter of the base. (For example, a standard War Machine base is a round 60mm base).
Two models are considered to be in base contact with each other if their bases are touching one another, including
corner to corner contact.
Multipart Models
Models with more than one Characteristics Profile are called Multipart Models. For example, a cavalry model is a model
with two parts (the rider and its mount), a chariot can be described as a single model consisting of five parts (two
horses, two crewmen and one chariot chassis), while a normal foot soldier is a model which consists of a single part.
Each part of such a model has its own Characteristics Profile and can be referred to as a "model part".
Units
All models are part of a unit. A unit is either a group of models deployed in a formation consisting of ranks (along the
width of the unit) and files (along the length of the unit) or a single model operating on its own. Whenever a rule, ability,
spell and so on affects a unit, all models in the unit are affected. When forming a unit, all models in the unit must be
perfectly aligned in base contact with each other and face the same direction. All ranks must always have the same
width, except the last rank which can be shorter than the other ranks; if so, this is called an incomplete rear rank. Note
that it's perfectly fine for the last rank to have empty gaps in it, as long as the models are aligned with those of the other
ranks.
Rank-and-File
Normal models in a unit are called Rank-and-File models (R&F). Characters are not R&F models, but all other models
are.
Full Ranks
A Full Rank is any rank which is at least 5 models wide. Some units (such as Monstrous Infantry) require less than 5
models to form a Full Rank, see Troop Types section for details.
25
Horde Formation
Units in ranks of 10 or more models (6 or more in the case of Monstrous Ranks) are considered to be in Horde
fo
rmation.
Footprint
A unit's Footprint is the area occupied by the combined bases of all the models in a unit.
Centre of Unit
A unit's Centre is defined by drawinganimaginaryrectanglearoundtheouteredgesoftheunit'sFootprint.TheCentre
of this box is considered to be the Centre of the unit.
Unit Facing and Arcs

direction).

unit has 3 ranks and 5 files. The

Fo
otprint is the area occupied by the
bases of all the models within the unit
(t
he green area). The Centre of the unit
is
the centre of the rectangle drawn
around its outer edges (marked with a
red x). The front, side and rear arcs are
defined by using a 135° angle from the
unit's edges.
26
Recover Wounds and Raise Wounds
Some spells or abilities can recover Wounds lost earlier in the battle. The amount of Wounds recovered is noted in the
ability (Recover [X] Wounds). If a unit contains multiple models, each model must recover all of its lost Wounds before
another model can recover any Wounds. A Character inside a unit never recovers Wounds from abilities that allow a
unit to recover Wounds. Characters only recover Wounds when they are the only target of an ability or spell.
Recovering Wounds can never bring back dead models, and cannot increase a model's Wounds above its starting value.
Any excess recovered Wounds are lost.
Raise Wounds uses the rules for Recover Wounds with the exception that Raise Wounds can bring back dead models.
First, recover all lost Wounds on models in the unit (except for Characters), then bring back models in the following
order: Champion, Standard Bearer, Musician, R&F. However, a Captured Standard cannot be brought back, and any used
One Use Only or destroyed magic items (or other equipment) are not regained. Each raised model must be recovered to
its full amount of Wounds before another model can be raised. This cannot raise a unit's number of models above its
starting number. Once again, any excess Raised Wounds are lost.
Summoned Units
Summoned units are units created during the game. All models in a newly Summoned unit must be deployed within the
Range of the ability. If the unit is summoned as a result of a Ground type spell, at least one of the summoned models
must be placed on the targeted point and all models must be within the spell's Range. Summoned models must be
placed at least 1" away from other units and from Impassable Terrain. If the whole unit cannot be deployed, then no
models can be deployed. Once summoned, the newly created unit operates as a normal unit on the spellcaster's side.
Summoned units do not award VP to the opponent when they are destroyed.
27
Movement Phase
In the Movement Phase you have the chance to move your units on the Battlefield.
The Movement Phase Sequence
The Movement Phase is divided into the following steps.
1 Start of the Movement Phase (and start of the Player Turn).
2 Declare Charges.
3 Move Chargers.
4 Compulsory Moves.
5 Remaining Moves.
6 End of Movement Phase.
Declaring Charges
If you want any of your units to engage an enemy unit in Close Combat, you must declare which of your units will
attempt to charge which enemy unit, one at a time. Each time the Active Player declares a charge, the ReactivePlayer
must declare the charged unit's Charge Reaction.
Charges can only be declared at targets that are in the charging unit's Line of Sight and that the charging unit has a
chance of completing the charge against. This means that the targetunitmustbewithinthecharger'spotentialCharge
Range and there must be enough room to move the charger into base contact with its target. When considering if a
charge is possible, do not take potential Flee Charge Reactions into account (not even mandatory ones), but do take
already declared charges into account (since charging models might have a chance to move out of the way).
28
Charge Reactions
A unit that has a charge declared against it must now declare its Charge Reaction. There are three different Charge
Reactions: "Hold", "Stand and Shoot" and "Flee".
Hold
A Hold reaction means that the unit does nothing. A unit Engaged in Combat can only choose a Hold reaction.
Stand and Shoot
A StandandShootreactionmaybetakenifthechargedunithasShootingWeapons,thechargingenemyisintheirFront
Arc and the chargingunitisfurtherawaythanitsMovementvalue(usingthelowestvalueintheunitifithasmorethan
one). The charged unit immediately performsaShootingAttackasifintheShootingPhase,eveniftheenemyisbeyond
the weapon's maximum Range. (Remember to apply any applicable modifierslikeLongRangeandStandandShoot).A
unit can only choose this Charge Reaction once per turn, even if it is charged multiple times.
Flee
The charged unit immediately flees directly away from the charging enemy (in the direction of a line drawn from the
Centre of the charging unit through the Centreofthechargedunit).AfteraunitcompletestheFleemovement,anyunit
that declared a charge towards this unitmayimmediatelyattempttoRedirecttheirCharge.Analreadyfleeingunitthat
is charged must always choose to flee.
Redirecting a Charge
When a unit chooses the Flee Charge Reaction, the charger maytrytoRedirecttheCharge.Ifso,rollaLeadershipTest.
If failed, the unit will try tocompletethechargetowardstheunitthatfled.Ifpassed,theunitcanimmediatelydeclarea
new charge towards another viable target unit, which may choose their Charge Reaction as normal. If more than one
unit declared a charge against the fleeing unit, each may try to redirect its charge in any order chosen by the Active
Player. A unit can only redirect a charge once per turn. If the situation arises that a unit redirects a charge and the
second target also flees, the charging unit may opt to Charge either target, but must declare which before rolling the
Charge Range.
29
Move Chargers
Once all charges and Charge Reactions have been declared, chargers will try to move into combat. Choose a unit that has
declared a charge in this phase and roll its Charge Range.
Charge Range
A unit's Charge Range is normally 2D6, plus the unit's Movement Characteristic. If this is equal to or higher than the
distance between the charger and its intended target, the Charge Range is sufficient and the charger can proceed to
make a Charge Move (provided it has enough space). If the Charge Range is less than the distance (or there is no space
to complete the charge), the charge has failed and the charger performs a Failed Charge Move.
Charge Move
A Charge Move is resolved as follows:
- The unit may move forward up an unlimited distance.
- A single Wheel can be performed during the move. This Wheel may not exceed 90°.
- The front of the charging unit must contact the enemy unit in the Facing where the majority of the charging
unit's frontage was when the charge was declared (see figure 4). If the frontage of the charging unit is equally
split in two, randomize which of the two Facings the unit is in before declaring any Charges.
- The charging unit ignores the Unit Spacing rule. It can still only move into base contact with an enemy which it
declared a charge against.
Aligning Units
If the charger manages to move into base contact, the units must now be aligned towards each other until their entire
Facings are in contact. To accomplish this maneuver, the Active Player rotates the charging unit around the point where
it contacted the enemy. If this will not bring the two units into full contact, for example due to interfering Terrain or
other units, players may rotate the charged unit instead if this will achieve proper contact between them, or do a
combination of the two, rotating the enemy unit as little as possible. The enemy unit can never be rotated if it is already
Engaged in Combat. Align moves ignore the Unit Spacing rule.
Maximizing Contact
Charge moves must be made so that the number of models (on both sides) in base contact with an enemy model is
maximized, prioritizing previously Unengaged models (i.e. not already in base contact with an enemy) over already
Engaged models whenever possible. Sometimes, this requirement comes into conflict with rotating the enemy unit as
little as possible when aligning. When this is the case, prioritize not rotating the enemy at all. If this is not possible,
prioritize maximizing models in base contact instead (see figure 5).
Charge Fleeing Unit
When charging a fleeing unit, follow the same rules as for a normal Charge Move, except that the charging unit can move
into contact with any Facing of its target, no aligning is made and no maximizing of base to base contact is taken into
consideration. Once the charger reaches base contact with the fleeing target, the fleeing unit is removed as a casualty.
The charging unit can take a Leadership Test. If the test it passed, the unit may perform a Post-Combat Pivot
manoeuvre.
30
Multiple Charges
If more than one unit has declared a charge against a single enemy unit, charges are moved in a slightly different
manner. Roll Charge Range for all the units charging that same unit before moving any of them. Once it has been
established which units will reach their target, move the charging units (and/or the Failed Charges) in any order you
wish. When maximizing the number of models in base contact, take into consideration the total combined number of
models in base contact from all units that successfully completed the charge, prioritizing getting as many units into
combat as possible over Maximizing Contact.
Impossible Charge
When moving the charges, this sometimes resultsinasituationwhereunitsblockeachotherfromreachingcombat(or
there is not enough space tofitallchargers).Whenthishappens,theunitsthatcannolongermakeitintocombatmake
a Failed Charge Move.
Blocked Path
To prevent certain abusive situations where a unit cannot charge an enemy unit wellwithinChargeRangeandLineof

charge solely due to unengaged enemyunitsthatitcouldnotchargenormally,itcanmakeaspecialchargemove:Move
the unit straight forward up to its Charge Range. If this brings it into contact with the enemy, the enemy is charged.
Instead of doing the normal aligning, the enemyperformsaCombatReforminordertobringtheunitsalignedtowards
each other (Combat Reform in such a way that the correct facing is turned towards the enemy).
Failed Charge
If a unit does not roll a sufficient Charge Range, or is unable to complete the Charge for other reasons, it performs a
Failed Charge Move instead. The highest D6 rolled when rolling Charge Range is the move distance. Wheeltheunitso
that a forward movement will move the centre of the unit towards the centre of its intended target, and then move
fo
rward. Note that this is not a Charge Move and thus the Unit Spacing rule is not ignored. If the charged unit was
destroyed before moving the charger, mark the final centre of the unit and move towards that point. A unit that has
fa
iled a Charge cannot move any further in this movement phase and cannot shoot in the subsequent Shooting Phase.
Fig
ure 4
Th
e majority of the charging unit's frontage is in the enemy's front arc, so the charging unit must contact the front facing
(n
eeded Charge Range is 1"). It moves forward and then wheels into base contact. Align move is then performed by rotating
the charged unit around the point of contact.
31
Fig
ure 5
Th
e charging purple unit tries to maximize models in base contact. However the units cannot be aligned without the
charged unit making an Align Move (a). Since the charging unit can move into contact without the enemy Aligning (b), it
must do so instead.

Compulsory Moves
In the Compulsory Moves sub-phase, models that do not have a choice concerning whether to move or not (such as

A unit that has rallied cannot move any further in this movement phase and cannot shoot in the subsequentShooting

Flee Moves
To perform a Flee Move, roll the Flee Distance, which is normally 2D6". Move the fleeing unit this distance straight

Fleeing Units
When a unit is fleeing, it cannot perform any voluntary actions (if the unit would normally not have the option ofnot
doing an action, it cannot perform that action if fleeing). This includes (but is not limited to): DeclareCharges,Charge

One Use Only items which need to be activated. Other models cannot receive Inspiring Presence orHoldYourGround
fr
om a fleeing General or Battle Standard Bearer.
33
Remaining Moves
In the Remaining Moves sub-phase, units that haven't moved yet will get a chance to do so.
1. Start of the Remaining Moves sub-phase Phase. Reinforcements arrive.
2. Choose a unit to move and a type of move (Advance, March, Reform), then move it.
3. Repeat step 2, each time choosing a new unit that has not yet moved in the Movement Phase.
4. Once all units that can (and want to) move have done so, the Remaining Moves sub-phase ends.
Advance Move
When performing an Advance Move, a unit can move forward, backwards or to either side (sidestep). However, it
cannot move in more than one of these directions during an Advance Move. Units consisting of a single model can
always perform any number of Pivots during an Advance Move.
Forward: The unit moves forward a distance up to its Movement Characteristic. During a forward Advance Move, a unit
may perform any number of Wheel Manoeuvres.
Backwards: The unit moves backwards a distance up to half its Movement Characteristic. For example, a unit with
Movement Characteristic 5 could move backwards 2½".
Sidestep: The unit moves to either side a distance up to half its Movement Characteristic.
March Move
When performing a March Move, the unit can only move forward, up to twice its Movement Characteristic. During a
March Move a unit may perform any number of Wheel Manoeuvres.
If there areenemyunitswithin8"ofaunitthatwishestoperformaMarchMove(beforetheunitisactuallymoved),the
unit must take a March Test. Take a Leadership Test. Ifthetestispassed,theunitmayproceedwithitsMarchMoveas
normal. If the tests is failed, the unit must still make a March Move, however, it can only move up to its Movement
Characteristic. A unit that has Marched cannot shoot in the Shooting Phase. Units consisting of a single model can
always perform any number of Pivots during a March Move.
Reform
Mark the Centre of the unit. Remove the unit from the Battlefield, and then place it backontheBattlefieldinanylegal
fo
rmation (following the Unit Spacing rule) with its Centre in the same place as before. After the Reform, no single
model can be further away fromitsstartingposition(beforethereform)thantwiceitsMovementCharacteristic.Aunit
that has Reformed cannot shoot in the Shooting Phase.
34
Pivots and Wheels
When a unit Pivots (a move mostly used by single model units), mark the Centre of the unit. Remove the unit from the
Battlefield, and then place it back on the Battlefield again facing any direction with its Centre in the same place as before
(following the Unit Spacing rule, as normal). When a unit Wheels, rotate the unit around either of its front corners.
Measure the distance moved by the unit by using the distance covered by the outermost model's outer edge. In addition,
when one or more Wheels are made as part of a move, no model in the unit can move more than its Movement value (or
more than twice its Movement value during a March) from its starting position. If the move was made as part of a Swift
Reform, this distance is measured from the position after the reform.
Fig
ure 6
All units in the above examples have Movement 5. The green unit makes two Wheels during a March Move. This unit counts
as moving 10" (since you measure distances from the outermost model's outer edge). The turquoise unit makes a single
Wh
eel during its March Move. However, even though the outer model has only moved 9", there are models in the unit that
have moved more than 10", making this move illegal. The yellow unit makes a single Wheel during its March Move. This
unit counts as moving 10" (since you measure distances from the outermost model's outer edge). Note that no model has
moved more than 10" from its starting position.
35
Magic Phase
In the Magic Phase, your Wizards can cast spells and your opponent can try to dispel those spells.
Wizards
Models that can cast (non-bound) spells are referred to as Wizards. All Wizards have the Channel special rule.
Wizard Level
A model's Wizard Level indicates the number of spells it knows. If a Wizard loses Wizard Levels, it loses one spellfor
each level lost (unless stated otherwise, the lost spell is randomly chosen). A Wizard's Level cannot dropbelow0,but
they will still lose spells (if they have any left) when losing Wizard Levels. Level 0 Wizards are still Wizards in all
regards.
Wizard Apprentices
Wizards of levels 1 and 2 are called Wizard Apprentices. They add +1 to their casting and dispelling rolls.
Wizard Masters
Wizards of levels 3 and 4 are called Wizard Masters. They add +2 to their casting and dispelling rolls.
If a Wizard's level increases or decreases for any reasons, its casting and dispelling bonus also changes.
Spells
SpellscanbecastduringtheMagicPhase.ThespellsaWizardknowsareusuallyrandomizedbeforethegame,usingthe
rules given under Generate Spells. Most spellsbelongtoaspecificPathofMagic.EachofyourWizardshastochoosean
available Path of Magic to generate spells from; this choice has to be written down in your army list. All spells are
defined by the following 5 properties:
Spell Name
Use the spell name to state which spell you intend to cast.
Casting Value
The Casting Value is the minimum value you need to reach to successfully cast the spell. Spells may have different
casting values available (see Boosted Spells).
Type
A spell's Type describes how the spell's targets have to be chosen. A spell can have morethanonetype.Ifso,applyall
targeting restrictions at the same time. For example, if a spell has the types "Range 12", "Hex",and"Direct",thetarget
must be within 12", be an enemyunitandbeinthecaster'sfrontarc.Unlessstatedotherwise,aspellcanonlyhaveone
target.
Duration
A spell's Duration determines how long the effects of the spell are applied.
Effect
The Effect of a spell defines what happens to the target of the spell when the spell is successfully cast (and not
dispelled).
36
Boosted Spells
Some spells have more than one casting value, the higher casting values being called the 'boosted' versions of the spell.
Boosted versions may have their Range and/or target restrictions modified (for example giving the spell a longer
Range), or the effects of the spell may change. Before casting a spell, the player chooses carefully and announces which
version of the spell they will use, knowing that a higher version will be more difficult to cast but will be more powerful.
Declare if you are trying to cast a boosted version (and which one, if the spell has more than one) before rolling any
dice. If no declaration is made, the lowest available casting value for the chosen target is assumed to be used.
Spell Types
A spell's Type describes which target(s) can be chosen for the spell. Unless stated otherwise, the target must be a single
unit.
Augment
Spells with the "Augment" Type may only choose friendly units (or models inside units if focused) as targets.
Aura
Auras are "area of effect" spells. When casting an Aura spell, all legal and possible targets (according to the rest of the
Spell Types) have to be chosen as targets of the aura spell. For example, a spell with "Aura", "Augment" and "Range 12""
targets all friendly units within 12".
Caster
Spells with the target restriction "Caster" target only the model casting the spell.
Caster's Unit
Spells with the target restriction "Caster's unit " target only the caster's unit.
Character only
Spells with the target restriction "Character only" may only choose Character models (including their mounts) as
targets.
Damage
Spells with the target restriction "Damage" may only choose targets not currently Engaged in Combat.
Direct
Spells with the target restriction "Direct" may only choose targets which are in the caster's front arc.
Focused
With a "Focused" spell, only single models can be chosen as targets (including a Character inside a unit). If the target is a
model with more than one part (such as a chariot with 2 riders and 2 pulling beasts, or a knight and its mount), only one
part may be chosen as the target.
Hex
Spells with the target restriction "Hex" may only choose enemy units (or models inside units if Focused) as targets.
37
Ground
Spells with the target restriction "Ground" don't target units or models. Instead, a "Ground" spell's target is a point on
the Battlefield, chosen by the casting player.
Line Template
To resolve a "Line Template" spell, draw a straight line from the centre of the front of the caster's base to the target. All
models underneath this line are affected by the spell. Note that this line is a Template.
Missile
Spells with the target restriction "Missile" may only choose targets within the caster's Line of Sight. A Missile spell
cannot be cast if the caster (or its unit) is Engaged in Combat.
Range X"
Spells usually have a maximum Range, indicated with "Range X". Only targets within the given distance can be chosen.
Vortex (Range X", Template Y")
To resolve a "Vortex" spell, place a Template of the specified size in base contact with the caster, with the Centre of the
Template within the caster's front arc, and then roll a D6:
* If 1-5 is rolled: multiply the result by the value of the Vortex's Range (in brackets); this is the distance the
Template moves towards the chosen target (which is always a point on the board, since all Vortex spells are
also "Ground" Spells).
* If a 6 is rolled: centre the Template over the caster and move it D6" in a random direction.
All models under the path of the Template (from starting to finishing position) are affected by the spell. Once it has
reached its final position, the Template is removed from play and the spell ends automatically.
Universal
Spells with the target restriction "Universal" may choose both friendly and enemy units (or models inside units if
"Focused") as targets.

Dispel "Remains in Play" Spells. If an affected unit is divided into several units (the most common example is that a

39
Magic Phase Sequence
1 Start of the Magic Phase. Roll for Magic Flux and Channelling.
2 "Remains in Play" spells may be dispelled (see Dispel "Remains in Play" Spells).
3 The Active Player may attempt to cast one spell (see Spellcasting Sequence).
4 Repeat steps 2-3 of this Sequence until neither player performed an action.
5 End of the Magic Phase. Resolve end of phase triggered abilities.
Magic Flux and Channelling
In the Magic Phase, spells are cast and dispelled using Magic Dice. The Active Player has Power Dice; the Reactive Player
has Dispel Dice. Both Power and Dispel Dice are referred to as Magic Dice. These dice are kept in a pool of dice, from
which a number of dice can be used to either cast or dispel spells. A single pool of dice cannot ever contain more than
12 Magic Dice at any given time, nor can a single player use more than 12 Magic Dice during a single Magic Phase. No
more than 2 Magic Dice can be generated by each side on top of those generated by the Magic Flux, in a single Magic
Phase.
At the start of the Magic Phase, the Active Player makes a Magic Flux roll with 2D6. The Power Dice pool is equal to the
total Magic Flux roll, while the Dispel Dice pool is equal to the highest D6 of the rolled 2D6. Immediately after the Magic
Flux roll, the Active and the Reactive Player can each make a single Channel attempt. A Channel attempt is resolved by
rolling a D6. Add +1 to the result of this roll for each non-fleeing model with the Channel special rule in your army (all
Wizards have the Channel special rule). If the result is a 7 or higher, the player may add one Magic Dice to their pool.
Dispel "Remains in Play" Spells
Starting with the Reactive Player, each player can try to dispel "Remains in Play" spells. A caster can automatically
dispel its own active "Remains in Play" spells without using any Magic Dice, while an opposing caster must make a
Dispel Attempt. Dispel Attempts are done using Magic Dice (Power or Dispel) as Dispel Dice and following "Dispel
Attempt" in the Spellcasting sequence. To successfully dispel an opposing "Remains in Play" spell, the dispel attempt
must be equal to or higher than the lowest required casting value of the "Remains in Play" version of the spell
(ignoring casting values of boosted versions).
The Guessing Game
The Reactive Player should not know if the Active Player has the intention to dispel a "Remains in Play" spell or not, so
the Reactive Player has to take the dispel decision first. They have to choose if they want to risk spending Dispel Dice on
"Remains in Play" spells that the Active Player might want to dispell anyway, or keep the dice and risk that the Active
Player does nothing and ends the Magic Phase immediately, leaving the "Remains in Play" spell in play (see the Magic
Phase Sequence).
40
Spellcasting Sequence
Each of Active Player's non-fleeing Wizards (or models with Bound Spells) may attempt to cast each of its spells up to
one time per Magic Phase. Each Casting Attempt is resolved as follows:
Casting Attempt
1 The Active Player declares which Wizard is casting which spell and with how many Power Dice. If applicable,
they also declare which version of the spell is used and what its targets (and Attribute's targets) are. A
minimum of 1 and no more than 5 dice can be used.
2 The Active Player rolls that many Power Dice (from the Power Dice pool, provided they have enough dice). Add
the results of the rolled dice and any casting modifiers (such as Overwhelming Power) together to get the total
casting roll.
3 The Casting Attempt is successful if the total casting roll is equal to or higher than the spell's Casting Value.
Otherwise, the caster suffers from Lost Focus and the Casting Attempt failed.
If the Casting Attempt is successful, the spell is not cast yet. The Reactive Player may choose to make a Dispel Attempt to
prevent the spell from resolving.
Dispel Attempt
1 The Reactive Player declares which (if any) of their non-fleeing Wizards will attempt to dispel the spell and how
many Dispel Dice will be used. A minimum of 1 dice and up to all the dice in your dice pool can be used. A dispel
may be attempted even without having any Wizard.
2 The Reactive Player rolls that many Dispel Dice (from the Dispel Dice pool, provided they have enough dice).
Add the results of the rolled dice and any dispel modifiers (such as Overwhelming Power) together to get the
total dispel roll.
3 The Dispel Attempt is successful if the total dispel roll is equal to or higher than the total casting roll. If so, the
spell is dispelled, and the casting failed. Otherwise, the Dispel Attempt fails and the dispelling Wizard suffers
fr
om Lost Focus.

If the spell was not dispelled, it is successfully cast. Apply the spell's effects, then apply the Path Attribute's effects. If the
spell was cast with Overwhelming Power, apply the effects of the Miscast.

Lost Focus
A Wizard who suffers from Lost Focus cannot add any bonus (such as Wizard Level, Overwhelming Power etc.) to
fu
rther casting or dispel rolls this Magic Phase. A Wizard with Lost Focus still suffers from all the negative
consequences of an Overwhelming Power, but won't get the casting/dispel bonus.
Not Enough Power
When rolling casting or dispel rolls with a single Magic Dice, a result of '1' or '2' on the Magic Dice is always a failed
casting or dispel attempt, regardless of any modifiers.
Overwhelming Power
When casting ordispellingaspellandtwoormoreMagicDicerollanatural'6',thecasting/dispelattemptisperformed
with Overwhelming Power. When this happens, immediately add a casting/dispel modifier to the total roll, equal to
D3+MDU, where MDU ("Magic Dice Used") is the number of Magic Dice used to cast/dispel thespell.Ifacastingrollis
performed with Overwhelming Power and the spell is not dispelled, the casting Wizard also suffers a Miscast.
Miscast
Roll 2D6 and apply the table on the left.
The Strength ofanyhitcausedbyaMiscast
is equal to the Magic Dice used (MDU) +2,
and all such hits have Armour Piercing (1)
and Magical Attacks. The miscasting
Wizard cannot take saves of any kind
against Miscast effects.
Afterwards, remove a number of Magic
Dice from your Dice Pool equal to MDU.

42
Path Attributes
Path Attributes are special spells that cannot be cast independently. Instead, they are always cast automatically
(provided there are any available targets) each time another spell from the same Path has been successfully cast and
that spell's effect has been resolved. Attributes cannot be dispelled.
Bound Spells
Some spells are defined as Bound Spells. A Bound Spell is a spell that is usually contained in a magical object of some
sort. Bound Spells can be cast by models that are not Wizards, but possessing a Bound Spell does not make a model a
Wizard. Bound Spells cannot be used to cast boosted versions of the spell they contain.
Casting a Bound Spell
Casting a Bound Spell follows the same rules as casting a regular spell (including casting the Path Attribute spell) with
the exception that no casting modifiers can be added to the casting roll and that the caster of a Bound Spell never
suffers from Lost Focus. To successfully cast a Bound Spell, the casting roll must be equal to or higher than the spell's
Power Level.
Power Level
The Power Level of a Bound Spell is essentially the spell's Casting Value. If a spell has both a Power Level and a regular
Casting Value, the Power Level takes precedence.
Overwhelming Power
A Bound Spell does not get the casting modifier from an Overwhelming Power.
Miscast
If an Overwhelming Power is rolled when casting a Bound Spell, do not apply the normal Miscast procedure; instead,
apply the following:
* If the Bound Spell was cast with 4 or more Power Dice, the Bound Spell is lost and cannot be used again during
the game.
* Remove a number of Magic Dice from your Dice Pool equal to MDU.
Dispelling a Bound Spell
When dispelling a Bound Spell, add a +1 modifier to the Dispel Roll.
Magical Move
All moves made during the Magic Phase are Magical Moves. The move is performed as if in the Remaining Moves
sub-phase, which means that it follows the same rules and restrictions as if this was a new Remaining Moves sub-phase
(for example, fleeing units or units in combat cannot move). Actions that a unit could normally do in the Remaining
Moves sub-phase can be made (such as Wheeling, Reforming, joining units, leaving units and so on), except that the unit
cannot March. A Magical movement always has a given limit (for example, "target may make a 12" Magical Move"): this
distance is used instead of the target's Movement Characteristic (no Marching is allowed). If a unit has already done a
Magical Move in this Magic Phase, it cannot move again.
43
Shooting Phase
In the Shooting Phase, models with Shooting Attacks get a chance to use them.
Shooting Phase Sequence
The Shooting Phase is divided into the following steps.
1 Start of Shooting Phase.
2 Select a unit and perform a Shooting Attack.
3 Repeat step 2 with a different unit that has not fired during this Phase yet.
4 When all units that can (and want to) shoot have done so, the Shooting Phase ends.
Shooting With a Unit
Each unit (with a Shooting Weapon) can shoot once per Shooting Phase. Units that areFleeing,EngagedinCombat,or
that have Marched, Reformed, Rallied, or Declared a Charge in their previous Movement Phase cannot shoot.
When a unit shoots, first nominate a target within the shooting unit's Line of Sight. Units that are Engaged in Combat
cannot be chosen as targets. Allmodelsinthesameunitmustshootatthesametargetand only models in the 1st and
2nd rank may fire . If the models in the unit have more than one type of Shooting Weapon, declare which weapon is
used. All R&F models except Champions must use the same type of weapon. ChampionsandCharactersarefreetouse
other types of Shooting Weapons if they wish. Any model in the unit is free to choose not to shoot.
Check the Line of Sight foreachmodel.RememberthatLineofSightisalwaysdrawnfromthefront!Modelsthatdonot
have a Line of Sight to the target unit cannot shoot. Measure the Range for each individual shooting model. This is
measured from the actual position of each shooting model to the closest pointofthetargetunit(evenifthisparticular
point is not within Line of Sight). Models that are further away from the target thantheRangeoftheirweaponcannot
shoot. Once it has been established which models can shoot, roll to hit with each model (as described below).
44
Shooting To-Hit Rolls
When rolling to hit with Shooting Attacks, use the Ballistic Skill of the shooting model. If the model has more than one
profile (such as a knight riding a horse), use the part of model that is actually performing the Shooting Attack. The
player controlling the shooting unit rolls a D6 and adds the Ballistic Skill of the shooting model. If the result is 7 or
higher, the attack hits. An unmodified roll of '1' is always a miss. If one or more hits are scored, follow the procedure
described under Attacks and Damage.

To-Hit Modifiers
Most Shooting Attacks may suffer one or more to-hit
modifiers to their to-hit rolls. Simply add all to-hit
modifiers to the result of the dice when rolling to hit. The
list below shows the general to-hit modifiers, but spells
and abilities can add additional to-hit modifiers on top of
these.
To-Hit Modifiers Summary
Long Range -1
Moving and Shooting -1
Stand and Shoot -1
Soft Cover -1
Hard Cover -2
Long Range (-1 to hit)
If the target is further away than half of the weapon's Range, the shooting model receives a -1 to hit modifier.
Remember that you measure Range for each shooting model individually.
Moving and Shooting (-1 to hit)
It the unit has moved during this Player Turn, all models in the unit receive a -1 to hit modifier.
Stand and Shoot (-1 to hit)
Shooting Attacks made as part of a Stand and Shoot Charge Reaction receive a -1 to hit modifier.
45
Cover
Cover is determined individually for each model in a unit that is shooting. There are two types of Cover: Soft Cover and
Hard Cover. In both cases, Cover is worked out using the Line of Sight of the shooting model. Draw Lines of Sight from a
chosen point on the front of the shooting model's base (for Cover purposes, this can be drawn outside its front arc) to
all the target's Footprint. If these lines are interrupted by models or Terrain, the shooting model may suffer to-hit
penalties, depending on what types of models/Terrain the Line of Sight is interrupted by and how much of the Line of
Sight is interrupted. Models always ignore their own unit and the target unit for Cover purposes, and also ignore
whatever Terrain Piece they are inside (so a unit shooting from a Forest doesn't suffer a Soft Cover penalty for shooting
through that Forest).
Target Behind Soft Cover (-1 to hit)
A model shooting at a target behind Soft Cover receives a -1 to hit modifier. Soft Cover applies if half or more of the
target unit's Footprint is obscured by one or more of the following:
* Soft Terrain.
* Models (of any size). When shooting with or at models of Large Height, ignore models of Small Height for the
purpose of Soft Cover.
Target Behind Hard Cover (-2 to hit)
A model shooting at a target behind Hard Cover receives a -2 to hit modifier. Hard Cover applies if half or more of the
target unit's Footprint is obscured by one or more of the following:
* Hard Terrain
* Models of the same or larger Height than both the shooting model and its target.
Target Behind Hard And Soft Cover
If a model is suffering from both Hard Cover and Soft Cover, only apply the Hard Cover penalty. If the target unit's
Footprint is obscured by both Soft and Hard Cover, but not enough to grant either Hard Cover or Soft Cover, the
shooting model suffers Soft Cover penalty if half or more of the target unit's Footprint is obscured by models or Terrain
fr
om either the Hard Cover or Soft Cover list. For example, if 30% of the target unit are obscured by Soft Terrain and
30% by Hard Terrain, the shooting model still suffers the Soft Cover penalty (see Figure 9).

However, more than half is obscured by the combination

47
Close Combat Phase
In the Close Combat Phase, the players' models Engaged in Combat can (and must) strike.
Close Combat Phase Sequence
Each Close Combat Phase is divided into the following steps.
1 Start of Close Combat Phase. Apply any "No Longer Engaged".
2 Choose a combat to fight in.
3 Fight a Round of Combat.
4 Repeat steps 2 and 3. Each time choose a new combat which has not already been fought during this
Close Combat Phase.
5 Once all units that are Engaged in Combat have fought, the Close Combat Phase ends.
A Combatisdefinedasagroupofopposingunits,whichareallconnectedthroughbasecontact.Normally,thiswouldbe
two units pitted against one another, but it could also be several units against a single enemy unit or a long chain of
units from both sides. Complete all actions in theRoundofCombatSequenceofallunitsinvolvedinthechosencombat

Units are considered Engaged in Combat if one or more models in the unit is in base contactwithanenemyunit.Ifa
unit is Engaged in Combat, all models in the unit arealsoEngagedinCombat.UnitsthatareEngagedinCombatcannot
move unless specifically stated (such as during Combat Reforms or Breaking from combat).
No Longer Engaged
A unit follows the rules for No MoreFoesifitwasEngagedinCombatpreviously,buthadallofitsopponentsmovedor
removed between the previous Movement Phase and this Close Combat Phase (and base contact could not be
maintained through nudging, following the instructions under "Dropping Out of Combat"). That unit may do a
Post-Combat Pivot (or Overrun if it just charged) before any combats are fought. This cannot be done if the unit has
moved since the opposing units was removed (such as with a Magical Move).
48
Round of Combat Sequence
Each Combat Round is divided into the following steps:
1 Start of Round of Combat.
2 Choose Weapon (see Combat Weapon section).
3 Make Way (see Character section).
4 Issue and Accept Challenges (see Character section).
5 Roll attacks (in Initiative order):
1. Allocate attacks.
2. Roll to hit, to wound, saves, and remove casualties.
3. Move to the next Initative step.
6 Calculate which side wins the Round of Combat. Loser(s) rolls Break Test.
7 Roll Panic Test for nearby units.
8 Restrain or Pursue?
9 Roll Flee distance and move Fleeing units.
10 Roll Pursue distance and move Pursuing units.
11 Post-Combat Pivots.
12 Combat Reforms.
13 End of Combat Round. Proceed to the next combat.
Combats are fought in a strict striking order, starting with the attacks that have Initiative 10 and then working
downwards from the highest to the lowest Initiative. At each Initiative step, all attacks that have the same Initiative
strike simultaneously. Under normal circumstances, a model strikes at the Initiative specified on its profile. However,
some attacks are made at a different Initiative step than the model's own Initiative (such as Chariots' Impact Hits, which
are Initiative 10). For models with more than one profile (such as a knight and its mount), each part of the model strikes
at its own Initiative.
49
Who Can Strike
Models in base contact with an enemy attack when it is their turn in the Initiative order. Models from both sides attack
in each player's Close Combat Phase.
Supporting Attacks
Models in the 2nd rank perform one Supporting Attack across models in the first rank. Supporting Attacks can only be
made against enemies in the front.
Horde Formation
Models in units that are deployed in Horde Formation (see Units and Formations) gain the Fight in Extra Rank special
rule.
Incomplete ranks, fighting over gaps
Sometimes, incomplete ranks or Characters with a Mismatching base will cause empty gaps in a Close Combat. If two
units are in base contact, models in these units are allowed to attack over empty gaps (but not across other units or
Impassable Terrain). These models are considered to be in base contact with each other.
Fig
ure 10
Models colour-coded with a darker shade can all strike.
Th
e magenta unit is in Horde formation and thus both
the 2nd and 3rd rank can make Supporting Attacks. The
green unit is not Engaged in the front, so its models
cannot make Supporting Attack to their side or rear.
Models with a bold frame count as being in base contact
with an enemy (models are considered to be in base
contact across empty gaps), models colour-coded with a
lighter shade cannot make Supporting Attacks.
50
Allocating Attacks
At each Initiative step, before any attacks are rolled, attacksmustfirstbeallocatedagainstenemymodels.Ifamodelis

more than one attack, it can allocate them at will to different targets in base contact. If a model is making Supporting
Attacks, it can allocate its attack as if it was in the front of the unit (in the same file). If a model could either strike at
models in base contact or make Supporting Attacks, it mustallocateitsattacksagainstmodelsinbasecontact.Allocate
all attacks at a given Initiative step before rolling any to-hit rolls.
If a R&F model can allocate its attacks against a model in a unit, it may always choose to allocate any number of its
attacksagainstR&Fmodelsinstead(inthesameunitasitsinitialtarget),i.e.R&Fmodelsarenotlimitedtoonlystriking
models in base contact but can always attack the unit as a whole instead. In cases whereR&Fmodelsinthesameunit
do not all have the same relevant Characteristics or rules (such as a different Weapon Skill), use the value that the
majority of the R&F models have (attacker chooses in case of a tie). These attacks are distributed as ShootingAttacks
(distribute before rolling to hit). Note that thisdoesnotapplytoCharacters,whocanonlyallocatetheirattacksagainst
models in base contact.
Rolling to Hit
To make a to-hit roll, roll a D6 for each attack and compare the Weapon Skill of the model making the attacks (the
attacker) to the Weapon Skill of the model against which the attack was allocated (the defender).
- If the defender has a lower Weapon Skill than the attacker, the attack hits on 3+ .
- If the defender has a Weapon Skill equal to or up to twice that of the attacker, the attack hits on 4+ .
- If the defender has a Weapon Skill more than twice that of the attacker, the attack hits on 5+ .
51
Close Combat To-Hit Table
Roll a D6 for each attack. To find out what score is needed to successfully hit the target, cross-reference the Weapon
Skill of the attacker (A-WS) versus the Weapon Skill of the Defender (D-WS).

other. The magenta and green models can strike at the
R&F models of the other unit. The models with a bold
frame can strike at Characters/Champions. The models
in yellow (without bold frame) and purple cannot strike
at all. Character C
1 cannot strike because the only model
it is in base contact with is a Champion that is locked in
a Challenge.
52
Dropping out of Combat
Removing casualties may cause units to drop out of base contact with their foe. When this happens, units are nudged
into combat using the following procedure:
1. TheunitthatisgoingtodropoutofCloseCombatwhilenotsufferingcasualtiesismovedtheminimumamount
needed to keep the units in base contact.
2. If this will not bring the units back into contact, move the unit suffering casualties the minimum amount
needed to keep the units in base contact.
Units that are in base contact with other enemy units can never be nudged in this way. Nudged units cannot move
through other units or Impassable Terrain, but they are allowed to move within 1" of other units inthesamecombat.
Nudge moves cannot be used to change the facing in which any unit is fighting (which means that if the unit was
attacked in the flank before the nudge move, this must still be true after the nudge move). If several units dropoutof
combat at the same time, move them in the order that allows the maximum number of units to stay in combat. If this
number is equal, the Active Player decides the order.
If nudging either unit does not manage to bring the units back intocontactwitheachother,theunitdropsoutofClose
Combat. Any units that are no longer Engaged in Combat follow the rules given under No More Foes.
If base contact was lost due to units deliberately moving out of combat (some spells allow units to move out of
combats), do not nudge the units back together. Instead follow the rules for No More Foes.
53
Winning a Round of Combat
Once all models' Initiative steps have passed (i.e. all models have had a chance to attack), the winner of this Round of
Combat is determined. This is done by calculating each side's Combat Score. To calculate Combat Score, simply add up
all Combat Score bonuses. The side with the higher Combat Score wins the combat, the side with the lower Combat
Score loses the combat. If there is a tie, both sides are treated as winners (a Musician can tilt the balance, see
Musicians).
Inflicted Wounds: +1 for each Wound
Each player adds up the number of unsaved Wounds inflicted to enemy units (Engaged in the same Close Combat)
during this Round of Combat. This includes enemies that were Engaged in the combat but dropped out or were
completely wiped out during this Round of Combat.
Overkill: +1 for each Wound (maximum +3 )
In a Challenge, excess Wounds inflicted after the opponent was killed are counted towards the Combat Score. A
maximum of +3 can be added to your Combat Score due to Overkill. Note that excess Wounds are only counted when in
a Challenge, in all other situations, excess Wounds are simply lost.
Charge: +1 or +2
During the first Round of Combat after a unit charged into this combat, the charger's side receives +1 to their Combat
Score. If this charge was started with half or more of the unit's Footprint on a Hill and ended with half or more of its
Footprint no longer on the Hill, you receive +2 to your Combat Score instead. Each side can only count this bonus from
one unit in the same combat.
Rank Bonus: +1 for each rank (maximum +3)
Each side adds +1 to their Combat Score for each Full Rank after the 1st in a single unit, up to a maximum of +3. Only
count this for a single unit per side. (Use the unit that gives the highest Rank Bonus).
Standard: +1
Each side adds +1 to their Combat Score if they have one or more Standard Bearers Engaged in the combat.
Battle Standard: +1
Each side adds +1 to their Combat Score if they have one or more Battle Standard Bearers in the combat.
Flank Bonus: +1 or +2
Each side adds +1 to their Combat Score if they have one or more units fighting an enemy in the enemy's flank. If at least
one of these units has one or more Full Ranks, add +2 instead.
Rear Bonus: +2 or +3
Each side adds +2 to their Combat Score if they have one or more units fighting an enemy in the enemy's rear. If at least
one of these units has one or more Full Ranks, add +3 instead.

Break Test
Each unit on the side that lost the Round of Combat must take a Break Test. The order is chosen by the losing player. A
Break Test is a Leadership Test with a negative modifier equal to the Combat Score difference (i.e. if the Combat Score
was 6 to 3, the units on the losing side take Break Tests with a -3 modifier). If the test is failed, the unit Breaks and
Flees.
Steadfast
Any units that have more Full Ranks than each of the enemy units Engaged in the same combat ignore Leadership
modifiers from the Combat Score difference.
Disrupted
If a unit is Engaged in Combat with an enemy unit with at least 2 Full Ranks and this enemy is in the unit's flank or rear,
the unit cannot use the Steadfast rule.
No More Foes
Sometimes a unit kills all enemy units in base contact and finds itself No Longer Engaged in Combat (so they cannot
provide Combat Score bonuses such as Standards or Flank). These units always count as winning the combat, and can
either make an Overrun (if applicable) or a Post-Combat Pivot.
When this happens in multiple combats, the Wounds caused to and by the unit are counted towards the Combat Score,
but all other Combat Score bonuses are ignored. Note that the unit itself doesn't need to take a Break Test since it
always counts as if on the winning side.
55
Pursuits and Overruns
Before moving broken units, units that are in base contact with the broken unit(s) may declare a Pursuit of a single
broken unit. To be able to pursue a broken enemy, the unit cannot be Engaged with any non-broken enemy units. Units
can elect not to pursue, but must then pass a Leadership Test to succeed in restraining themselves; if the test is failed,
the unit must pursue anyway. If the test is passed, the unit may do a Post-Combat Pivot.
Post-Combat Pivot:
A unit may Pivot around its Centre and may reorganize models with the Front Rank rule (they must still be in legal
positions). This move is made after the pursuing and fleeing units have been moved.
Overrun
A unit that fought its first Round of Combat (since it charged into the combat) and wiped out all units in base contact
(including units being removed from play as a result of Unstable or something similar), can choose to make a special
Pursuit Move called Overrun (instead of a Post-Combat Pivot). Overruns follow the rules for moving pursuing units,
except that the direction of the Pursuit Move is always straight forward and no Leadership Test is required for
restraining from pursuit.
Flee Distance and Fleeing Units
Every broken unit now rolls 2D6 to determine their flee distance. The fleeing unit will flee directly away from the
enemy unit in base contact that has the most Full Ranks. If there is a tie concerning which unit has the most ranks, the
player whose units are not fleeing chooses which of these units the flight will be directed away from. Once it has been
established which unit the flight will be away from, Pivot the fleeing unit so that it is facing directly away from this unit
(measure from Centre of Unit to Centre of Unit) and move the fleeing unit directly forward a number of inches equal to
the flee distance rolled earlier. Use the rules for fleeing moves (with the exception that units that are Engaged in the
same combat do not cause Dangerous Terrain tests). Keep the flee distance noted next to the fleeing unit, since it will be
needed to determine whether or not the pursuers catch the fleeing unit. If several units are fleeing from the same
combat, the units move in the same order as their flee distance was rolled (the player controlling the units chooses in
which order they roll the flee distance).
56
Pursuit Distance and Pursuing Units
Once the final positions of all fleeing broken units have been determined, each unit that has declared a Pursuit now rolls
2D6 to determine its Pursuit distance. If any pursuing unit rolls an equal or higher Pursuit distance than the flee
distance of the unit it is pursuing, the fleeing unit is destroyed. Remove that unit from the game; no saves or special
rules can save it. Do however keep track of where the Centre of said unit was just before it was removed.
The pursuing unit rotates around its Centre (by the shortest route) to face towards the Centre of the pursued unit (or
the point where the unit was, if it was destroyed). This rotation ignores obstructions (it can move through models and
Terrain).
* After the rotation, if the frontage of the pursuing unit would be over an enemy unit, it charges that unit.
Remove the pursuing unit from the Battlefield and then place it back on the table with its front in base contact
with its target (in the correct arc and maximizing the number of Engaged models as usual). If there is not
enough room to place the charging unit, treat the obstructing unit as Impassable Terrain (see below).
* Otherwise, if after the rotation the frontage of the pursuing unit would be over a friendly unit or Impassable
Terrain, the unit rotates so that it faces as close as possible towards the pursued unit, stopping 1" away from
the obstruction and then stops its pursuit movement.
* If neither of the cases above are applicable, the unit ignores any obstruction while rotating, and then moves the
pursuit distance directly forward. If, while moving, the pursuing unit won't be able to clear an obstruction
ignored during the initial Pivot (including 1" distance, unless charging), follow the normal procedure for Unit
Spacing, i.e. backtrack the move to the unit's latest legal position where it was 1" away from other units.
(Usually, this means that the unit doesn't move, but instead rotates as close as possible).
In case this Pursuit movement would bring the unit into contact with an enemy unit, it automatically declares a Charge
against said unit, using its pursuit distance roll as its Charge roll. This Charge follows all the rules for Charges except
that no Charge Reactions are allowed. If this creates a new Combat, it will be resolved in the next Player Turn (with the
charging unit still counting as charging). However, if the charging unit joins an ongoing combat that hasn't been fought
this turn yet, it will have a chance to fight and pursuit again this turn. This special Charge cannot be made towards a
unit that just fled from a combat involving the pursuing unit. Treat such unit as a friendly unit for the pursuit move
(including the initial rotation).
If the pursuing unit doesn't declare a charge this way, it moves directly forward (following the Unit Spacing rule).
If several units are pursuing from the same combat, units move in the same order as their pursuit distance was rolled
(the Active Player chooses which player will roll for their pursuing units first, and each player chooses the order of their
own units).
Pursuing off the Table
If pursuing units moving this way touch the board edge, they will go off the table and will come back to the board during
the controlling player's next Remaining Moves sub-phase, using the rules for arriving Ambushers (they automatically
arrive), except that they must be placed (in the same formation) with their back rank centred on the point at which they
contacted the Board Edge, or as close as possible. Models that have pursued off the table, cannot do any actions at all,
and all items, rules, abilities stop working while off the table.

In these examples, the purple unit is in the green unit's flank. The green
unit wins combat, the purple unit Breaks and Flees, the green unit pursues.
In this example, there are no obstructions. The green unit rotates towards
the purple unit and then moves forward.
Here, the green unit's rotation leaves its front over an enemy unit (pink).
Th

makes the green unit charge the pink unit. Place the green unit in base
contact with the pink unit.
Here, the green unit's rotation leaves its front over a friendly unit (light
green). In this case, the rotation is stopped 1" away from the friendly unit.
Here, the green unit's rotation leaves part of the unit over another unit
(b
lue - it could be either friendly or enemy). However, in this case, the front
of the pursuing unit is clear, so it will move forward.

Combat Reform
If there are still units left Engaged in the combat after all the fleeing and pursuing has been rolledandmoved,eachof
these units may try to perform a Combat Reform. Units Engaged in more than one facing (for example,bothfrontand
fl
ank) can never perform a Combat Reform. Units on the losing side of the combat must pass a Leadership Test to be
able to perform a Combat Reform, with a Leadership value equal to what would have been used for a Break Test (i.e.
apply the Combat Score difference, unless the unit is Steadfast).
If both players want to perform Combat Reforms, the Active Player chooses which player goes first. This player
completes allCombatReformswithalltheirunits(oneatatimeinanyorder),beforetheotherplayercanreformanyof
their units.

At the end of each Combat Reform, you must have at least as many models in base contact with an enemy as youhad
before the Reform. Any Character models that were in base contact with an enemy must be kept in base contact
(although it can be with different enemy models). Furthermore, at the end ofallyourCombatReforms,theexactsame

59
Attacks and Damage
Attacks are divided into Close Combat and Ranged Attacks:
Close Combat Attacks
Any attacks made at units in base contact with the attacker's unit, in the Close Combat Phase (or as if in the Close
Combat Phase) are Close Combat Attacks.
Ranged Attacks
All attacks that are not Close Combat Attacks are Ranged Attacks. Miscasts and many spells are also Ranged Attacks.
All Ranged Attacks made in the Shooting Phase or made as a Stand and Shoot Charge Reaction are referred to as
Shooting Attacks.
Special Attacks
Certain models are allowed to make Special Attacks during the Close Combat, Movement or Shooting Phase. By default
the Special Attacks can not benefit from weapon bonuses or special rules that normally affect attack of their category.
All Special attacks are explicitly marked as such. The examples are Stomp, Grinding Attacks, Crush Attack, Impact Hits,
Breath Weapon.
Attack Sequence
Whenever an attack hits a model, use the following sequence:
1 Attacker Distributes hits.
2 Attacker rolls to wound; if successful, proceed.
3 Defender rolls Armour Saving Throws; if failed, proceed.
4 Defender rolls special saving throws; if failed, proceed.
5 Defender removes Wounds or casualties.
6 Defender checks for Panic.
Complete each step for all the attacks that are happening simultaneously (such as all Shooting Attacks from a single unit
or all Close Combat Attacks at a given Initiative step) before moving on to the next step.
60
Distribute Hits
All attacks that target a unit as a whole (this includes most Ranged Attacks andSpecialCloseCombatAttacks),arenot
distributed (under normal circumstances) considered toonlyhitR&Fmodels.WhenCharactersarejoinedtounits,this
may change, as described in the Character section. When this happens and Ranged Attacks are to be distributed, the
player making the attack chooses which models take the hits. These hits must be distributed as equally as possible,
meaning that each model must be hit once before any model can be hit twice, and so on.
Normal Close Combat Attacks are not distributed, butareinsteadAllocatedbeforeto-hitrollsaremade.Inthiscase,do
not redistribute the hits at this stage. Close Combat Attacks that are made towards the unitasawhole(suchasStomp
and Impact Hits) are distributed.
In cases where R&FmodelsinthesameunitdonotallhavethesamerelevantCharacteristicsorrules(suchasdifferent
Toughness values or different saves), use thevalueorrulesthatthemajorityoftheR&Fmodelshave(attackerchooses
if a tie), and apply them to all rolls (to-hit, to-wound, saves).
To-Wound Rolls
If an attack has a Strength value, it must successfully wound the target to have a chance to harm it. Compare the
Strength oftheattacktotheToughnessCharacteristicofthetarget.AnattackwithStrength0cannotwound.Otherwise,
a roll of '6' will always succeed and a roll of '1' will always fail. The player that inflicted thehitmakesato-woundroll

The Wounding Table
Roll a D6 for each hit. To find out what score is needed to successfully wound the target, cross-reference the Strength
(S) of the attack versus the Toughness (T) of the target.

61
Armour Saves and Armour Modifiers
If one or more Wounds are scored, the player whose unit is being attacked now has a chance to save the Wound(s). Roll
a D6 for each successful to-wound roll, called an "Armour Saving Throw" and compare it with the model's Armour Save
(see the Armour Types section).
If the Strength of an attack is higher than 3, this attack will modify the Armour Saving Throw by -1 for each point of
Strength above 3, i.e.
Strength 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Modifier 0 0 0 -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7
Special rules and abilities might further modify Armour Save rolls (such as Armour Piercing).
Regeneration and Ward Saves
If a Wound was notsavedbyamodel'sArmourSave,theattackedmodelnowhasafinalchancetodiscounttheWound,
by rolling its Regeneration or Ward Save (if it hasone).RegenerationandWardSavesworksimilarlytoArmourSaves,
except that they cannot be modified or combined. A Regeneration or Ward Save is always given with the minimum
score needed to be rolled on a D6 to discard the Wound within brackets (for example, a Ward Save (4+) means the
Wound is discounted on a roll of 4 or more).
Roll one saving throw for each Wound that was not saved by the model's Armour Save.
If a model hasmorethanoneRegenerationand/orWardSave,choosewhichonetousebeforerollingthesavingthrow.
Only a single Regeneration or Ward Save can be used against a single attack.
Ward Saves and Regeneration both work the same way, butsomespellsorspecialruleswillaffectonetypeofsavebut
not the other.
62
Inflicting Wounds
For each failed special saving throw (or Armour Saving Throw if the attacked model had no special save), the attacked
model loses a Wound.
Non-R&F models
If the attack was distributed or allocated onto a non-R&F model, the attacked model loses 1 Wound for each failed save.
If the model reaches 0 Wounds, the model is dead and is removed as a casualty. Keep track of models that are wounded,
but not enough to reach 0 Wounds. (Placing "Wound Markers" next to wounded models works fine). These lost Wounds
will be taken into account for future attacks. If the model is killed, any excess inflicted Wounds are ignored.
Champions
Even though Champions are R&F models, each Champion has its own Wound pool, and follows the rules for non-R&F
models above. If enough Wounds are suffered by R&F models in order to wipe out the entire unit, any remaining
Wounds suffered are allocated at the Champion (even if it is fighting in a Challenge).
R&F models
R&F models in the same unit share a common Wound pool. If the attack was allocated to a R&F model, the combined
R&F Wound pool loses 1 Wound for each failed save. If the R&F models have 1 Wound each, remove one R&F model for
each Wound lost.
If the R&F models have more than 1 Wound each, remove whole R&F models whenever possible. Keep track of models
that are wounded, but not enough to reach 0 Wounds. These lost Wounds are taken into account for future attacks. For
example, a unit of 10 Trolls (3 Wounds each) loses 7 Wounds. Remove two whole models (6 Wounds), leaving 1 Wound
which is kept track of. Later, this unit loses 2 Wounds, which is enough to kill a single Troll since 1 Wound was inflicted
in the previous attack.
If the unit is wiped out, any excess inflicted Wounds are ignored.
If a unit consists of R&F models with different Troop Types, each type of R&F model has its own combined Wound pool.
Sometimes, one or more R&F models gain special rules (for example, Characteristics may increase, abilities can be
gained, etc. - this is normally due to spells or Magical Items), or they come with different equipment. Such differences
are ignored when removing casualties. They are normally removed from the rear rank even if a model in the rear has
some special rule or equipment (i.e. only differences due to Troop Type cause R&F models to have separate Wound
pools).
63

applies to each batch of simultaneous attacks.
If a non-R&F model is standing in a position that would normally be removed as a casualty, remove the next eligible
R&F model and move the non-R&F model(s) inwards.
Removing Non-R&F models
Non-R&F casualties are removed from their positions within the unit directly. R&F models are then moved to fill in
empty spots. When doing this, the models follow the same guidelines as for casualty removal (from rear ranks and
equally from both sides in the case of single rank units).
Units Engaged in Combat
If the unit is in a single rank, remove casualties from either side of the unit, so that the number of units (highest
priority) and number of models (lowest priority) in base contact is maximized.
Panic Test
Panic Tests are Leadership Tests taken immediately after any of the following situations arise:
* A friendly unit is destroyed within 6" (including fleeing off the board).
* A friendly unit Breaks from combat within 6".
* A friendly unit flees through the unit.
* The unit suffers, in a single phase, casualties equal to or greater than 25% of the number of models that it had
at the start of the phase. This rule is called Heavy Casualties.
Units which fail a Panic Test flee from the closest enemy unit (Centre of Unit to Centre of Unit). If therearenoenemy
units on the board, randomize direction.
If the Panic Test was forced by any of cases listed below, the unit flees directly away(CentreofUnittoCentreofUnit)

64
Troop Types
All models and units have a Troop Type. A unit's Troop Type is the same as that of the majority of its R&F models (or all
models, if there are no R&F models); the opponent makes the decision if the numbers are equal. Each Troop Type has a
number of rules associated with it, as described below.

Models on Foot and Mounted Models
Certain spells or rules can affect mounted models or models on foot differently. For all purposes, Swarms, Infantry,
Monstrous Infantry, War Beasts, Monstrous Beasts, Monsters and War Machines are considered models on foot, unless
they are taken as a mount (such as a palanquin), in which case they are considered mounted. Cavalry, Monstrous
Cavalry, Ridden Monsters and Chariots are considered mounted models.
Character Mounts
Many Characters have the option of selecting mounts from the mount section of the Army Books. When a model rides a
mount, its Troop Type changes:
* A model mounted on a War Beast becomes Cavalry .
* A model mounted on a Monstrous Beast becomes Monstrous Cavalry .
* A model mounted on a Monster becomes Ridden Monster .
* A model mounted on any other Troop Type becomes whatever Troop Type its mount is (but counts as a
mounted model instead of a model on foot). In this case, the model gains Combined Profile and Cavalry
Support.
The entire combined model (Character, mount and possibly additional riders/crew members that are part of the
mount) follow the rules for Characters. Riders/crew member that are part of the selected mount do not count as
"mounts" (meaning they can for example use weapons/armour). These rider/crew members have their own equipment
which only they can use. However, the combined model has a single Armour Save, it must choose to either use the
Armour of the a rider/crew member (including Mount's Protection and Barding) or the Armour of the Character
(including Mount's Protection and Barding).
Troop Type Rules
Cavalry support
Mounts cannot make Supporting Attacks.
Monster Ranks
A unit with this rule only needs to be 1 model wide to form a Full Rank.
Monstrous Ranks
A unit with this rule only needs to be 3 models wide to form Full Ranks, and 6 models wide to form a Horde Formation.
Monstrous Support
Models with this rule may make up to 3 Supporting Attacks instead of 1.
66
Combined Profile
A model with this rule has separate profiles for each of its parts (such as a rider and its mount).
When attacking or shooting , each part of the multipart model uses its own Characteristics. Each part ofamodelcan
make a Shooting Attack in the same phase, but must choose the same target. A crew member or rider can choose to
shoot a weapon carried by the chariot instead of its own weapon.
In other situations, the multipart model is considered tobeasinglemodelwithasinglesetofCharacteristics,defined
as follows:
Movement Use the Movement of the mount or pulling beast .
Weapon Skill Use the rider's WeaponSkillorthebestWeaponSkillamongriders/crewmenifthere

Toughness Use the highest Toughness among all parts.
Wounds Use the highest number of Wounds among all parts. When the model reaches 0
Wounds, remove all parts of the combined model as a casualty.
Leadership Use the rider's Leadership or the best Leadership among riders/crewmen if there is
more than one.
Armour and Saves Use the best Armour Save, Ward Save and Regeneration available among all parts.
Combined model's Armour Save can be increased by the Mount's Protection.
Ridden Monster's Profile

Armour and Saves Use the saves of the Monster. Any armour equipment worn by the rider or its
Ward/Regeneration Save have no effect, unless noted otherwise. Ridden Monsters
may only have Innate Defence armour type.
67
War Machine Profile
A War Machine is considered to be a single model with a single set of Characteristics, defined as follows:
Toughness Use the machine's Toughness against Ranged Attacks and the crew's
Toughness against Close Combat Attacks.
Wounds Use the machine's Wounds.
Other Characteristics
and Armour and Saves
Use the crew's Characteristics, Armour and other Saves.

Declare Flee as Charge Reaction. If a War Machine fails a Panic Test, instead of fleeing it cannot shoot in its next
Shooting Phase. When the model reaches 0 Wounds, remove all parts of the combined modelasacasualty.Characters
can never join units of War Machines.
When a unit charges a War Machine, follow the same rules as for normal Charge Moves, except that the chargingunit
can move into base contact anywhere (since all War Machines have round bases and thus don't have facings). War
Machines, and units Engaged in Combat with them, cannot make Combat Reforms. When fighting a War Machine in
combat, do not allocate attacks as normal. Instead, at thestartofeachRoundofCombatchooseupto6modelsthatare

Monstrous Infantry and Monstrous Beasts count as 3 models each, while Monsters and Ridden Monsters count as 6
models each. The chosen models may then attack the War Machine as if they wereinbasecontact,butnootherattack

Mundane Equipment
Combat Weapons
Weapons listed in this section are used in Close Combat and can confer various benefits and penalties. The rules for
these weapons only apply to the attacks made with the weapon in question (i.e. they don't apply to Special Attacks such
as Stomp). If a model has more than one Close Combat Weapon, it must choose which one to use at the start of each
combat, and must continue to use the same weapon for the duration of that combat. All R&F models in a unit must
choose the same Close Combat Weapon. Unless noted otherwise, mounts never benefit from weapons.
Weapon Special Rules
Hand Weapon All models are armed with a Hand Weapon. Hand Weapons cannot be lost, destroyed or
nullified by any means. If a model has any other Close Combat Weapon than a Hand Weapon,
it cannot choose to use the Hand Weapon (unless specifically stated). Hand Weapons can be
used alongside a Shield to get the Parry rule.
Parry: Close Combat Attacks from opponents in the front can never score successful hits on
to-hit rolls of better than 4+, before applying any to hit modifiers. This can only be used by
models on foot.
Flail Requires Two Hands. +2 Strength. Close Combat Attacks allocated at a model with a Flail
have a +1 bonus when rolling to hit.
Great Weapon Requires Two Hands. +2 Strength. Strikes at Initiative 0 (regardless of wielder's Initiative).
Halberd Requires Two Hands. +1 Strength.
Additional
Hand Weapon Requires Two Hands. +1 Attack and strikes with +1 Initiative.
Lance Grants +2 Strength in the Round of Combat directly after the Model has charged into combat.
This bonus can only be used for attacks directed against the charged enemies. Only mounted
models, War Beasts and Monstrous Beasts can use a Lance.
Light Lance Follows the same rules as a Lance, but only grants +1 Strength. Only mounted models, War
Beasts and Monstrous Beasts can use a Light Lance.
Spear Fight in Extra Ranks. Armour Piercing (1). Spears confer the Lethal Strike special rule
against Cavalry, Monstrous Cavalry and Chariots Engaged to the front. Mounted models
cannot use Spears.
69
Shooting Weapons
Weapons listed in this section are used for making Shooting Attacks. Each model can normally only use one Shooting
Weapon per phase even if it is equipped with more than one, and all R&F models in a unit must use the same Shooting
Weapon. Each Shooting Weapon has a maximum Range, a Strength value, and can have one or more special rules.
Special rules listed for a Shooting Weapon only apply to the Shooting Attacks made with that weapon.
Weapon Range Strength Special Rules
Shortbow 18" 3 Volley fire
Bow 24" 3 Volley fire
Longbow 30" 3 Volley fire
Crossbow 30" 4 Unwieldy
Handgun 24" 4 Unwieldy, Armour Piercing (1)
Pistol 12" 4 Quick to Fire, Armour Piercing (1)
Counts as an Additional Hand Weapon in Close Combat.
Brace of Pistols 12" 4 Quick to Fire, Armour Piercing (1), Multiple Shots (2)
Counts as an Additional Hand Weapon in Close Combat.
Throwing Weapons 12" Same as user Quick to Fire, Multiple Shots (2)
70
Artillery Weapons
Weapons listed in this section are a special kind of Shooting Weapons. These weapons are sometimes mounted on War
Machine Troop Type models, but can on other occasions be mounted on Chariots, carried by Monsters or contained
within Magical Items. Artillery Weapons are Shooting Weapons, and always have the Cumbersome special rule. Artillery
Weapons have specific profiles for Range, Strength and special rules, which you will find in their description. A Shooting
Attack from an Artillery Weapon is not resolved like other Shooting Attacks. Instead, use the rules below to determine
the hits they cause.
Catapult (Template X")
Place a Template of the size X", with its Centre within Line of Sight, over an enemy model and within Range. No part of
the Template may be placed over friendly models or units Engaged in Combat. Then Scatter the Template D6*2" to
determine the final position of the Template. If a natural '6' is rolled for the distance that the Template is moved (before
the multiplication by 2), the Catapult has misfired: the shot is discarded and the Catapult must roll on the Misfire Table.
The Centre of the Template can also be placed outside Line of Sight (but must still be over an enemy model, within
Range and not over friendly models or units Engaged in Combat). In this case, the Template does not stay in place if a
'Hit' is rolled. Instead, move the Template in a randomized direction, but reduce the distance the Template is moved by
the shooting model's Ballistic Skill (i.e. D6*2-BS"). If the result is 0 or less0, the Catapult has scored a direct hit.
Line of Sight Out of Line of Sight
Scatter D6*2" D6*2"
Hit direct hit D6*2 - BS"
Once the final position of the Template is determined, all models under the Template are hit, using the Strength and
special rules given by the Weapon's profile. Some Catapults have a higher Strength and/or additional special rules
stated in square brackets (such as Strength 3[9]). This means that the square bracketed part only affects a single model
directly under the Centre of the Template.
Flame Thrower
Place a 3" Template with its Centre within Line of Sight and Range. Then move the Template D6" straight away from the
Flame Thrower (centre of the model to the centre of the Template). If a '6' was rolled for the distance, the Flame
Thrower has misfired: the shot is discarded, and the Flame Thrower must roll on the Misfire Table with a -1 modifier.
Otherwise, all models touched by the Template during this D6" movement are hit, using the Strength and special rules
given by the Weapon's profile. Any unit that could potentially be hit by the Template (i.e. is under the Template's initial
position and 5" forward) is considered a potential target for the attack (and thus may not be a friendly unit or be
Engaged in Combat).
71
Bolt Thrower
Bolt Throwers follow the normal rules for shooting except that they can penetrate their target's ranks (or files), causing
additional hits. Determine the maximum number of possible hits by measuring in which of the Target's arcs the Bolt
Thrower is. If it is in the Front or Rear arc, the maximum number of hits is equal to the number of ranks in the target
unit. If the Bolt Thrower is in either flank arc, the maximum number of hits is equal to the number of files in the target
unit. If the Bolt Thrower hits its target, roll to wound and roll for saves as normal. If a model is removed as a casualty,
the bolt penetrates the rank (or file) and causes another hit on the target with a -1 Strength modifier. Keep adding hits
as long as a model is removed as casualty and each time add another -1 Strength modifier (to a minimum of 1). No more
hits than the "maximum number of hits" can be made (i.e. initial number of ranks or files).
Strength of first hit Strength of second hit Strength of third hit ... Maximum number of hits:
S S-1 S-2 etc. Initial number of ranks or files
Cannon (X")
Choose a target and roll to hit as normal. Ignore any to-hit modifiers from Hard and Soft Cover, and add +1 to hit if the
target has the Large Target special rule. If a natural '1' is rolled to hit, the Cannon has misfired: the shot is discarded and
the Cannon must roll on the Misfire Table. If a successful hit is scored, choose a point on the target unit within Line of
Sight and draw a Line Template directly away from the Cannon (from the centre of the model) a number of inches as
given in the bracket (X"). This line immediately stops if it touches impassable Terrain or walls.
The model under the cannonball's initial landing point suffers a hit with the Strength and special rules given in the
Cannon's profile, while the next models under the Line Template may suffer a hit with the same rules, except that the
Strength is halved. Starting with the model that was hit first (i.e. under to the landing point of the cannonball), roll to
wound and roll for saves as normal. If the model is removed as a casualty, continue rolling to wound against the next
model, and so on. If a model survives the hit, the cannonball stops and no more models are hit.
Strength of first hit Strength of second hit Strength of third hit ... To-hit conditions:
S S/2 S/2 S/2 Line Template and Line of Sight
Volley Gun
Volley Guns follow the normal rules for shooting with the following exceptions: all Volley Guns have the Multiple Shots
special rule, from which they never suffer to-hit penalties. If the number of shots is a predetermined number (such as
Multiple Shots (6)), the Volley Gun cannot misfire. However, if the number of shots is randomized (such as Multiple
Shots (2D6)), the Volley Gun can misfire. If one unmodified '6 ' (after rerolls) is rolled when rolling for the number of
shots, the Volley Gun has a -1 to hit modifier for this attack. If you roll two or more unmodified '6 ' (after rerolls) when
rolling for the number of shots, the Volley Gun misfired: all shots are discarded and the Volley Gun must roll on the
Misfire Table.
72
The Misfire Table
When an Artillery Weapon misfires, roll a D6 and consult the table below:
Dice result Misfire Effect
0
(or less)
Explosion!
All models within D6" of the misfiring model suffer a Strength 5 hit. The shooting model is
then destroyed. Remove it as a casualty.
1-2
Breakdown
The firing mechanism of the weapon is damaged. The model cannot shoot anymore with the
weapon for the rest of the game.
3-4 Jammed
The Artillery Weapon may not be fired in the controlling player's next Player Turn.
5+ Malfunction
The shooting model suffers a Wound with no Saves of any kind allowed.
73
Armour Types
The Armour Save of a model part is determined by its armour and possibly also by special rules and spells. Combine all
the armour pieces a model has to form a combined Armour Save. Each piece of armour adds +1 (or more) to the Saving
Throw, up to a maximum total of +6. If the Armour Saving Throw, including modifiers, equals 7 or more, the Saving
Throw is successful. An unmodified roll of '1' is always a failure.
There are 5 different types of Armour.
Suits of Armour
A model part can only wear a single Suit of Armour.
- Light Armour: +1
- Heavy Armour: +2
- Plate Armour: +3
Shields
A model part can only carry one Shield. In Close Combat,
a Shield cannot be used alongside a weapon with the
Requires Two Hands special rule.
- Shield: +1
Mounts
- Mount's Protection (6+): +1
- Mount's Protection (5+): +2
No matter how many mounts a model has, it still only
gains the largest bonus once.
- Barding: +1. Barding gives the mount -1 Movement.
Innate Defence
A model part can only use one instance of Innate Defence
(use the best available).
- Innate Defence (6+): +1
- Innate Defence (5+): +2
- Innate Defence (4+): +3
and so on.
Other
Special equipment and Magical Items (such as Helms), special rules, certain spells, and other rules can further alter a
model's Armour Save (up to a maximum total of +6).
For example, if a model has a Light Armour (+1), Shield (+1), Helm (+1) and is mounted on a steed with Mount's
Protection (6+) (+1) and with Barding (+1), it has a total of +5 to its Armour Saving Throws, meaning a score of 2+ will
equal 7 or more (and thus being a successful Saving Throw). Normally such an Armour Save would be referred to as a
2+ Armour Save. Note that with a total of +6 to Armour Save, no model can ever have a better save than 1+ (and even
with this, an unmodified score of '1' will always be a failed Armour Saving Throw).

Unless specifically noted otherwise, any model bought as part of the Heroes or Lords section of an Army Book is a
Character.
Lone Characters
All Characters can operate as a unit consisting of just a single model. In this case, follow the normal rules for units.
Characters Joined to Units
Characters can operate aspartofotherunits,byjoiningthem.ThiscanbedoneeitherbydeployingtheCharacterinthe
unit or by moving into contact with the unit during theRemainingMovessub-phase.UnitsthatareEngagedinCombat
or fleeing cannot be joined.
Characters can join other Characters to form a unit consisting only of Characters.
When a Character joins a unit, it is immediately moved toalegalposition(seeFrontRankrule),possiblymovingother
models backwards. A Character can freely choose any legal position it could have reached with its move (moving
through the unit it joins), possibly replacing other models with the Front Rank rule (move the displaced Front Rank
model aslittleaspossibleinordertokeepallmodelsinlegalpositions).IftheCharacterdoesnothaveasufficientmove
to reach itsdesiredposition,itmovestheshortestdistancepossible(fromitsstartingposition),inordertoreachalegal
position, and can only displace models without the Front Rank rule. When a Character joins a unit with just a single
rank, the owner can choose to either displace a model to the second rank, or to expand the unit's widthandplacethe
displaced model at either side of the front rank.
If a unit is joined by a Character,theunitcannotmoveanyfurtherinthesameRemainingMovessub-phase.Characters
joining a unit however do not affect if the unit counts as moving or not (for purposes of shooting etc.). The Character
itself still counts as having moved though.
Once joined to a unit, the Character is considered as part of the unit for all rules purposes. When moving a combined
unit with models with different Movement allowances, use the lowest Movement allowance in the unit to perform
Advance or March Moves.
Combined Unit wiped out
If a combined unit has all its R&F models (and its Champion) killed, leaving one or more Characters behind, the
remaining Characters keep forming a unit (which is still considered to be the same unit).
75
Leaving a combined unit
A Character can leave a combined unit in the Remaining Moves sub-phase if it isabletomove(i.e.ifitisn'tEngagedin
Combat, hasn't already moved, isn't fleeing, etc.). Roll a combined March Test for the whole unit before moving any
model, if necessary. Characters leaving a unit do notaffectiftheunitcountsasmovingornot(forpurposesofshooting
etc.). When leaving its unit, a Character can move through thisunit,andcanthusexittheunitfromanypoint(andmay
make a Flying Movement if it has the Fly special rule). The Character counts as apartoftheunituntilithasphysically
left it, which means that the Character will be subject tomovementalterationsduringthemovetoleavetheunit.Ifthe
Character does not have enough movement to be placed at least 1" away from the unit, it cannot leave the unit.
Charging out of a unit
A Character can also leave a combined unit by charging out of it. To do this, declare a Charge with a Character in the
combined unit (during the Declare Charges sub-phase as normal). If this is done, the unit itself (including other
Characters in the unit) cannot Declare Charges in the same Player Turn. Stand and Shoot Charge Reactions declared
against a Character charging out of a unit are all distributed onto the Character. When charging out of a unit, the
Character uses its own movement (and may even make aFlyingMovementifithastheFlyspecialrule),andisaffected
by movement alterations affecting the unit during the Charge Move.IftheChargeissuccessful,movetheCharacterout
of the unit and Charge as normal. If the Charge is not successful, the Character makes a Failed ChargeMoveoutofthe
unit. If the Failed Charge Move is too short to place the Character outside 1" of the combined unit, the Character
remains in the unit and the combined unit is treated as if it had failed a Charge.
Distributing hits at combined units
When an Attack hits a combined unit, there are two possibilities for distributing hits:
Characters are of the same Troop Type
-andThere are 5 or more R&F models in the unit
All hits are distributed onto R&F models, Characters
cannot suffer any hits.
When a Template hits a Character in a unit, the hit is
transferred to a R&F model.
Characters are of a different Troop Type
-orThere are 4 or less R&F models in the unit
The player making the attack distributes hits onto
R&F models and Characters. Hits must be distributed
as equally as possible, meaning that no model can
take a second hit until all models have taken a single
hit, and so on.
When a Template hits a Character in a unit, the
Character suffers the hit as normal.
If a unit of 5 or more R&F models contains several Characters of both the same and different Troop Type, Characters
with the same Troop Type as the R&F models are ignored for the hit distributions.
76
Front Rank
All Characters and Command Group models have the Front Rank rule. Models with this rule must alwaysbeplacedas
fa
r forward as possible in their unit. Normally this means thattheymustbeplacedinthefirstrank,butifthefirstrank
is full of other models with the Front Rank rule, they are placed in the second rank instead. If this rank is also full of
models with the Front Rank rule, they are placed in the 3rd rank, and so on.
When moving a unit that includes modelswiththeFrontRankspecialrule,thesemodelscanbereorganizedintoanew
position (still as far forward as possible) as part of the move. This can be done as a part of an Advance move, March,
Wheel or Reform move, and counts towards the Movement allowance of the unit(measurefromaCharacter'sstarting
position to its ending position to determine how far it has moved).
If a model withtheFrontRankspecialruleleavesaunitorisremovedasacasualty,thegapitleavesmustbefilledwith
models from other ranks, possibly moving up models with the FrontRankspecialrule,ifthismeanstheyaremovedto
positions further forward. If more than one model with the Front Rank special rule could move forward,theownerof
the models decides which model is moved forward. If all models with the Front Rank special rule already are as far
fo
rward as possible, fill any empty gaps with R&F models from the back ranks.
Sometimes Front Rankmodelsmustberedistributedinorderforallsuchmodelstobeasfarforwardaspossible.When
this happens, move as few models aspossibleinordertoalwayshaveallmodelswiththeFrontRankspecialruleasfar
fo
rward as possible.
Matching Bases
If a model withFrontRankhasthesamebasesizeastheR&Fmodelsinitsunit,orifitdoesnothavethesamebasesize
as the unit it is in, but its base is the same size as two ormoreoftheR&Fmodels'bases(suchasa40x40mmbaseina
20x20mm unit), this is called a Matching base. In this case, theCharacterisplacedintheunitasnormal,displacingthe
necessary amount of models. The front of the base should be as far forward as possible (as per Front Rank rule).The
model is considered to be in all ranks its base occupies for the purposes of calculating Full Ranks. For calculating the
number of models in the unit's ranks (such asforFullRanksorHordeFormation),thelargebasecountsasthenumber
of models it replaces.
Mismatching Bases
If, however, a model with the Front Rank rule does not have a Matching base (such as a 50x50mm base inside a
20x20mm unit), the baseisMismatching,andtheCharacterisplacedinbasecontacttothesideoftheunit,alignedwith
its front. Only two Mismatching bases can be joined to a single unit (oneateachside).Thesemodelsareconsideredto
be in the front rank of the unit, but are ignored when counting the number of models in each rank (such as for Full
Ranks or Horde Formation).

Ch
aracter C
1 is Mismatching and is placed next to the unit. Characters C2 and
C3
are matching and are placed inside the unit, as far forward as possible. This
unit is considered to have 3 Full Ranks (C1 does not count, but C2 counts as 2
models wide).
Wh
en Character C
4 joins the unit, the Musician must be moved to the side in
order to have all Front Rank models as far forward as possible.
Make Way
At step 3 of the Round of Combat Sequence, any Character placed in the front rank, and not in base contact with an
enemy model, may move intocontactwithanenemymodelthatisinbasecontactwiththefrontoftheCharacter'sunit.
To do this, the Character switches position with another model (or models) in its unit (these models cannot be
Characters). Characters with Mismatching bases can never perform a Make Way move.
78
The General
Choosing the General
In every army one model must play the role of the General. This model must be the Character with the highest
Leadership in your army, excluding the Battle Standard Bearer and Characters with the special rule "Not ALeader".If
two (or more) eligible Characters are tied for highest Leadership, you are free to choose which Character is your
General. This must be noted in the Army List. The General has the rule Inspiring Presence.
Inspiring Presence
A non-fleeingmodelwiththisrulegivesitsLeadershiptoallfriendlyunitswithin12".UnitsundertheeffectofInspiring
Presence can use the Leadership of the General instead of their own Leadership, if they wish to do so. This ability
fo
llows all the normal rules for using a Borrowed Characteristic, meaning that effects modifying the Leadershipofthe
General are applied before borrowing the General's Leadership. This borrowed Leadership may then be further
modified.
79
The Battle Standard Bearer
Choosing the Battle Standard Bearer
Some Characters can be upgraded to be the Battle Standard Bearer (BSB). This option will be noted under their unit
entry in their respective Army Book. An army may only include a single Battle Standard Bearer (One per Army). The
Battle Standard Bearer has the rule Hold Your Ground.
Hold Your Ground
A non-fleeing model with this rule gives "reroll failed Leadership Tests" to all friendly units within 12". These units
receive "reroll failed Leadership Tests" from the model with Hold Your Ground, and they may use this ability to reroll
any failed Leadership Tests.
Magical Standard
If a Battle Standard Bearer has the option to buy Magical Items, it is allowed to purchase a Magical Standard. This
Magical Standard may either be taken as part of the model's Magical Items point limit, or it can be taken without any
cost limitations (i.e. it could exceed the usual 50 points allowance for a Hero choice), but in this case the model cannot
take any other Magical Items.
Their Flag is Down
When a Battle Standard Bearer is removed as a casualty while Engaged in Combat, the Battle Standard is considered
captured by the opponent. When a Battle Standard Bearer Breaks from Combat, the Battle Standard is lost (along with
the Hold your Ground rule and any Magical Standard) and the model bearing it loses all the effects of the Battle
Standard, which is considered captured by the opponent.
80
Challenges
Issuing a Challenge
Characters and Champions Engaged in a Combat may issue a Challenge. At step 4 of the Round of Combat Sequence, the
Active Player may nominate one of their Characters or Champions and issue a Challenge. If no Challenge was issued, the
Reactive Player may nominate one of their Characters or Champions and issue a Challenge.
Accepting or Refusing a Challenge
If a Challenge was issued, the opposing player may now choose one of their own Engaged Characters or Champions in
the same combat to Accept the Challenge and fight the Character or Champions that issued the Challenge. The model
that Accepts the challenge must be in a unit that is in base contact with the model that issued the challenge.
If a Challenge isn't accepted this challenge is said to be refused. The player issuing the Challenge now nominates one of
their opponent's Characters, which could have accepted the Challenge, if there is any (note that Champions cannot be
nominated). This model's Leadership is reduced to 0 and it loses Stubborn until the end of the turn in which the combat
ends (or until the Character accepts or issues a Challenge). Also, it cannot make any Close Combat Attacks during this
Combat Round, and if it is a Battle Standard Bearer, it loses the Hold Your Ground rule and doesn't add +1 to its side's
Combat Score during this Combat Round.
Fighting a Challenge
If the Challenge was accepted, the Character or Champion issuing the Challenge and the Character or Champion that
answered the Challenge count as being in base contact with each other (even if their bases are not physically touching
each other) and must allocate all their attacks towards each other, including special attacks made towards units (such
as Stomp, Breath Weapons, Impact Hits, Grinding Attacks) which are always allocated to the opposing Character or
Champion (in the case of Stomp attacks, the opposing Character must be of a stompable Troop Type, otherwise the
Stomp attacks are lost). No other model can allocate attacks at either of these models and attacks/hits can never be
distributed onto a Character or a Champion in a Challenge. If a Character with more than one Initiative value (such as a
rider and its mount or a model with Stomp) kills its opponent before it has made all of its attacks, any of the remaining
attacks can be directed at the killed model (as if it was still alive and in base contact) in order to get an Overkill bonus.
If one of the models is killed or Breaks from Combat, the Challenge is considered to be over at the end of the Phase. If
neither model is killed before the next Round of Combat, the Challenge continues. No other Challenges can be issued in
the same combat until one of the models is killed.
Overkill
During a Challenge, any excess Wounds caused count towards the Combat Score, up to a maximum of +3.
81
Command Group
Certain units feature the option of upgrading regular models to Champion, Musician or Standard Bearer. These models
are known as the Command Group and have the rule Front Rank. If a Musician or Standard Bearer is to be removed as a
casualty, replace another R&F model with the Musician or Standard Bearer - it is assumed that another soldier picked
up their tool and responsibility. Champions however are not easily replaced and can be specifically targeted, wounded
and slain the same way as Characters. If enough Wounds are suffered by R&F models in order to wipe out the entire
unit, any remaining Wounds suffered are allocated at the Champion even if it is fighting in a Challenge.
Musician
Swift Reform
A unit with a Musician can make a Swift
Reform by taking a Leadership Test. If
the test is failed, the unit makes a
normal Reform. If the test is passed, the
unit makes a Reform with the following
exceptions:
- The unit is not prohibited from
shooting in the coming Shooting Phase.
- The unit can perform an Advance
Move after the Reform.
Onwards
In a situation where the combat results
in a tie, the side with a Musician wins. If
both sides have Musicians, neither side
wins. If a Break Test is caused by one
side winning through their Musician, no
Leadership modifier for losing the
combat is applied to the loser's Break
Test and Combat Reform Test (Unstable
units are unaffected).
Regroup
A fleeing unit with a Musician has +1
Leadership when taking its Rally Test.
Standard Bearer
Combat Bonus
A side with one or more Standard
Bearers adds +1 to its Combat Score.
Captured Standard
When a Standard Bearer is removed as a
casualty while Engaged in Combat, the
Standard is considered to be captured by
the opponent. When a Standard Bearer
Breaks from combat, replace the model
with a normal non-Command Group R&F
model. The Standard is captured by the
opponent and is lost for gaming purposes
(along with the Combat Bonus rule and
any Magical Standard).
Veteran Standard
Bearer
Some Standard Bearers in Core troops
may be upgraded to be the Veteran
Standard Bearer. The Veteran Standard
Bearer may take a Magical Standard
worth up to 25 points. The Veteran
Standard Bearer is One of a Kind, so only
a single model in the army (or two in the
case of a Grand Army) may be upgraded.
Champion
First Among Equals
All Champions have +1 Weapon Skill,
+1 Ballistic Skill and +1 Attack to their
Characteristics Profile. If this is a
model with more than one profile, the
Characteristics increase only affects a
single rider or crew member.
Ordering the Charge
When a unit with a Champion rolls for
their Charge Range, they always count
as rolling at least a '4'. If the Charge is
still failed, ignore this rule and use the
rolled dice to determine the Failed
Charge Move.
82
Terrain
Terrain Types
Dangerous Terrain
When a model Marches, Charges (excluding Failed Charges), Flees, Pursues or Overruns through, into, or out of a Piece
of Terrain which counts as Dangerous Terrain, it must take a Dangerous Terrain test. To do this, roll one D6. Models
with the Monstrous Troop Type roll two D6 instead, while Chariots, Monsters and Ridden Monsters roll four D6. For
each '1' rolled, the model takes a Wound with Armour Piercing (6).
A model never takes more than one Dangerous Terrain test for the same Piece of Terrain during a single move, but it
might have to take several Dangerous Terrain tests caused by different pieces of Terrain or abilities.
Obscuring Terrain
Line of Sight cannot be drawn through Obscuring Terrain. Some Obscuring Terrain allows models to move in or on
them (such as Hills), Line of Sight can be drawn into or out of (but never through) such Terrain Features.
If Obscuring Terrain obscures a target, it is considered to be within Hard Terrain.
Soft Terrain
Units in Soft Terrain benefit from Soft Cover if half or more of the target unit's Footprint is obscured.
Hard Terrain
Units in Hard Terrain benefit from Hard Cover if half or more of the target unit's Footprint is obscured.
Terrain Features
A Terrain Feature is a topographical area on the Battlefield that is a mixture of Dangerous, Obscuring, Soft or Hard
Terrain and may possess its own special rules.
Open Terrain
Open Terrain doesn't normally have any effect upon Line of Sight, Cover modifiers or Movement. All parts of the board
that are not covered by any other kind of Terrain are considered to be Open Terrain.
Impassable Terrain
Line of Sight: Impassable Terrain is Obscuring Terrain.
Cover: Impassable Terrain is Hard Terrain.
Movement: Models cannot move into or through Impassable Terrain. If a Charge Move has brought a model within 1"
of Impassable Terrain, the model (and its unit) is allowed to stay within 1" until moving outside this 1" distance.
83
Fields
Soft Terrain: Units with half or more of their Footprint inside a Field benefit from Soft Cover, except Large Targets.
Dangerous Terrain: Fields are Dangerous Terrain to Cavalry, Monstrous Cavalry and Chariots.
Easy to Blaze: Units with half or more of their Footprint inside a Field count as Flammable. Models with Flaming
Attacks (either on the model or on a weapon) treat Fields as Dangerous Terrain.
Hills
Obscuring Terrain: Hills block Line of Sight.
Soft Terrain: A unit partially on the Hill counts the Hill as Soft TerrainifthehillobscureshalformoreofitsFootprint
fr
om the shooter's Line of Sight.
Hard Terrain: A unit completely off the Hill counts the Hill as Hard Terrain if the hill obscures more than half of its
Footprint from the shooter's Line of Sight.
Elevated position: Models with more than half of their base on a Hill are considered to be ofLargeHeightforLineof
Sight and Cover purposes.
Charging downhill: A unit initiating a Charge Move with half or more of its Footprint onaHillandendingtheCharge
Move with half or more of its Footprint no longer on the Hill receives +1 to its Combat Score in its next Round of
Combat.
Forests
Cover: Forests are Soft Terrain.
Movement: Forests are Dangerous Terrain for Cavalry, Monstrous Cavalry, Chariots and units making a Flying
Movement.
Steadfast: Units with the majority of their Footprint in a Forest can never be Steadfast. SkirmishersandloneInfantry
Characters with the majority of their Footprint in a Forest are Stubborn.
Ruins
Cover: Ruins are Hard Terrain for any unit with half or more of its Footprint inside, except Large Targets.
Movement: Ruins are Dangerous Terrain for anyunitexceptSkirmishers.Cavalry,MonstrousCavalryandChariotsfail
Dangerous Terrain tests in Ruins on a roll of '1' or '2'.
Water
Movement: Units may not March into, through, or out of Water Terrain. Water Terrain is Dangerous Terrain for
Cavalry, Monstrous Cavalry and Chariots.
Disordered for combat: A rank of models that is at least partially inside a Water feature can never count as a Full
Rank. If the majority of a unit is inside a Water feature, the unit counts as having 0 FullRanks.Disorderedforcombat
does not affect a unit with the Strider or Strider (Water) special rule.
Walls

Movement: A Wall is Dangerous Terrain for Cavalry, Monstrous Cavalry and Chariots.
Combat: Models defending a Wall (see below) get theDistractingspecialrulewhenattackedbyunitschargingthemin
the same facing that the wall is, but only for the first Round of Combat of the charging unit.
Defending a Wall: In order to defend a Wall, a model must be aligned and in base contact with it.
84
Buildings
Line of Sight: Buildings are Obscuring Terrain.
Cover: Buildings are Hard Terrain.
Entering a Building: Units comprised entirely of Infantry, Monstrous Infantry, War Beasts, Monstrous Beasts and/or
Swarms may enter an empty Building by getting into base contact in the Remaining Moves sub-phase. The entire unit
enters the Building and no model in the unit may move more than three times its Movement Characteristic while doing
so (measure the distance from the models' starting position to the closest point of the Building). Units of the above
mentioned Troop Types can also be deployed inside an empty Building. While inside the Building, the centre of the unit
is considered to be the centre of the Building, and Range to and from models in the unit is measured to the edge of the
Building. (Note that this means that for deploying units other than Scouting units inside Buildings, the Building must be
completely within your Deployment Zone). A unit inside a Building is always considered to have 1 rank (not Full Rank)
and 1 file. Models inside a Building gain the Flammable special rule until they leave the Building.
Leaving a Building: A unit in a Building may abandon it in the Remaining Moves sub-phase, but cannot do so in the
same turn during which it entered that Building. When it leaves, the unit is deployed in any formation with its back rank
touching the Building and all models within twice their Movement Characteristic from the Building. The unit may not
move anymore in this phase. Units in a Building cannot Declare Charges. A Building can also be left when fleeing
(through failed Panic Tests or Breaking from combat). When this happens, first check the direction of flight and
measure where the centre point of the unit would end up. Then place the unit with its centre at this point, with its front
fa
cing in the direction of flight and in any legal formation in which the unit follows the Unit Spacing rule. If this is not
possible, deploy the unit in any legal formation, still with its front facing in the direction of flight, and move the unit
along the flee direction until it can be placed.
Shooting from a Building: Units shooting from a Building count as being of Large Height. No more than 15 models (or
5 in the case of Monstrous models) may shoot from a Building.
Ranged Attacks against units inside Buildings: Buildings are Hard Terrain for any unit inside the Building. If a
Template touches a Building, it is assumed to touch D6 models of the unit inside the Building. (In case the Template has
special rules for its centre, apply the rules for the centre for all models, but only if the centre touches the Building).
Other movement: Any unit that is not entering, leaving, or assaulting a Building treats Buildings exactly like
Impassable Terrain.
85
Assaulting a Building: Declaring and resolving Charges against a unit in a Building is done in the same way as against a
War Machine, including the fact that the charged unit cannot Flee as a Charge Reaction. Move the charging unit into
base contact with the building, maximizing contact as normal. Mounts (of any kind) may not fight the unit in the
Building in the ensuing combat, and any fighting model will not benefit from Impact Hits, Lances, Light Lances, Mount's
Protection or Barding Armour Saves. Up to 10 models that are not in base contact with any other enemies can fight from
each side and are then called Assaulting and Defending models, respectively. (Chariots, Monstrous Cavalry, Monstrous
Infantry and Monstrous Beasts count as 3 models each for this purpose, while Monsters and Ridden Monsters count as
6 models each.) These models are selected at the start of each Round of Combat, first by the Assaulting player and then
by the Defending player.
Each model can allocate its attacks to enemy models that are Assaulting or Defending models (to whom it will also
count as being in base contact with). After the combat ends, calculate the Combat Score as usual, except that the unit in
the Building counts as having no ranks for Combat Score or Steadfast purposes, and Standards (both ordinary
Standards and Battle Standards) only count if the models carrying them were part of the chosen fighting party for that
Round of Combat. After the combat is resolved, several different situations may arise:
* If the combat was draw, or the Assaulting unit(s) won, but the Defenders didn't Break, the Assaulting unit(s)
can choose to perform a Post Combat Pivot (ignoring the Building), and then be nudged back 1" from the
Building, or keep Assaulting the Building, in which case both units will count as Engaged and the Assault will go
on in the next Close Combat Phase. If an Assaulting unit is Engaged to other enemy units, it must choose to
keep Assaulting the Building.
* If an Assaulting unit won, and all its enemies broke from combat or were annihilated, an Assaulting unit can
choose to enter the Building (if able to) or to perform a Post Combat Pivot (ignoring the Building) and then be
nudged back 1". In the case of a Multiple Combat, it may also pursue an enemy unit that broke and was not
garrisoning the Building.
* If the Defending unit won, Assaulting units must pass a Break Test as usual or Flee from the combat. The
garrisoning unit may not pursue. If the Break Test is passed, Assaulting units can attempt to perform a Combat
Reform, applying the usual rules for units on the losing side of a combat. After that, Assaulting units are nudged
back 1" from the Building and the units are no longer Engaged.
86
Scoring and Victory Conditions
Scoring Victory Points
At the end of each game, add up your Victory Points (VP) according to the rules below:
Dead or Fled For each enemy unit that hasbeenkilledorhasfledtheBattlefield,yougainanumberof
VP equal to its point value.
Scared For each enemy unit that is fleeing on the Battlefield at the end of the game, you gaina
number of VP equal to half its point value (rounding up).
Decimated For each enemy unit that isatorbelow25%ofitsstartingnumberofWoundsattheend
of the game, you gain a number of VP equal to half its point value (rounding up).
Characters are counted separately from the units they have joined.
Their King is Dead If the enemy General was killed or has fled the Battlefield, you gain 100 VP.
Their Flag is Down If theenemyBattleStandardBearerwaskilledincombatorbrokefromcombat,yougain
100 VP.
Seized Standards For each enemy unit's Standard Bearer model killed in combat or broken from combat,
you gain 50 VP .
Secondary Objectives Securing Secondary Objectives grants additional VP.
Scoring Secondary Objectives
There are three SecondaryObjectivesthatcangrantextraVictoryPoints(unlessusingtheVictoryPointsTable).Before
picking Deployment Zones, you can agree with your opponent on one or more Secondary Objectives (if any at all), or
roll a D6 and consult the table below:
1-2 Hold the Ground TheplayerwiththemostScoringUnitswithin6"oftheCentreoftheBoardattheend
of the game gains an extra 20% of the game's point size in VP.
3-4 Breakthrough A player with one or more Scoring Unitsintheiropponent'sDeploymentZoneatthe
end of the game gains anextra 20% of the game's point size in VP .Ambushersthat
entered the Battlefield on Game Turn 4 or later don't count for this purpose.
5-6 Secure Target After determining Deployment Zones, both players each place one marker on the
Battlefield, starting with the player that picked DeploymentZone.Eachplayerhasto
place the marker more than 12" away from their Deployment Zone and 24" away
fr
om the other marker. At the end of the game, the player controlling the most
markers gains an extra 20% of the game's point size in VP .Amarkeriscontrolled
by the player who has the most Scoring Units within 6" of the marker.
87
Scoring Units
Scoring Units are used for capturing Secondary Objectives. All units with a Standard Bearer (including the Battle
Standard Bearer) are Scoring Units, unless the unit (or any model in the unit) has Free Reform. Fleeing units and units
consisting solely of Characters can never be Scoring Units.
Who is the Winner?
Once all the Victory Points are added together, compare the two results.
* If the difference in Victory Points is less than 5% of the game's point size, the game is a Draw .
* If the difference is at least 5% and up to 20%, it is a Minor Win for the player who scored higher.
* If the difference is more than 20% up to 60%, it is a Major Win instead.
* If the difference is more than 60% of the game size, the game is a Massacre .
This can also be noted numerically as 0 (Draw), 1 (Minor Win), 2 (Major Win) and 3 (Massacre), with the corresponding
negative numbers for the losing player.
Victory Points Table
Some players enjoy having the result of the game determined at a finer scale, such as a more refined 10-0 system. This
is commonly used in tournaments to be able to determine final standings with greater precision. You should decide
before the game if you are using the Victory Points Table or the standard system above. If this system is used, a total of
10 "Battle Points" are shared between the players, with more or less points to the winner depending on the Victory
Points difference. Calculate the Victory Points as normal, except that the Secondary Objective is not worth any
Victory Points but instead modifies the result directly by giving the player that won the Secondary Objective 2
additional Battle Points, and the player that lost the Secondary Objective loses 2 Battle Points. Use the chart below to
convert the Victory Points into Battle Points.

Special Rules
Special rules are effects and abilities that can apply to whole models, model parts, weapons and spells.
Special Rules and Multipart Models
Which parts of the model have the special rule?
When a multipart model has a special rule written on its profile, all its parts have this special rule unless stated
otherwise.
If a Character and its optional mount are listed under separate profiles, special rules that are listed under the
Character's profile are not transferred to its mount (as if all rules said "rider only"). The same applies for mounts taken
fr
om the mount section of the Army Book: their special rules are not automatically transferred to their riders.
Which parts of the model are affected by the special rule?
Special rules have one or more effects. Effects are applied to model parts or whole models. If a special rule has two or
more effects, these effects may work on different levels.
* Characteristics change
Effects changing the values of Characteristics only work on the model part which has the special rule.
* Special Attacks
Effects giving Special Attacks (such as Stomp, Grinding Attacks, Impact Hits, Breath Weapons) only work on the
model part which has the special rule.
* Attack modifiers
Effects modifying attacks (such as Lethal Strike, Armour Piercing, Hatred) only work on the model part which
has the special rule. Such effects are applied only to the Close Combat Attacks made by the model part (i.e. they
do not apply to Shooting and Special Attacks) unless noted otherwise (such as Magical Attacks and Poisoned
Attacks).
* Defence
Defensive effects (such as Armour Saves, Ward Saves, Regeneration, Fireborn, Distracting) always work on the
whole model.
The exceptions are Ridden Monsters: defensive effects specified for the rider are always ignored by the whole
model.
* Other
All other effects always work on the whole model, and apply to all its parts.
89
Effects and Units
Some effects only work at the unit level. Examples are movement effects (such as Flying or Fast Cavalry), deployment
effects (such as Scout or Vanguard), effects related to Break Tests (such as Unstable or Unbreakable) and effects
enabling or forcing the unit to perform a special action (such as Frenzy).
Some special rules specify how many models with this special rule the unit must have in order to be affected. For the
sake of counting the models, multipart models are considered as having the special rule if at least one model part has it.
For example, consider a Character that mount a Monstrous Beast with Frenzy. By default, Frenzy is not transferred to
the rider, so it does not receive the attack bonus. However, when deciding whether to take a Frenzy test, to pursue or to
overrun, the whole model is considered as having Frenzy.
Weapons and Special Rules
If a weapon has a special rule that modifies attacks, then only attacks made with that weapon will benefit from that rule.
For example, a Handgun with the special rule Armour Piercing will perform Armour Piercing Shooting Attacks. The
model will not benefit from the Handgun's special rule when performing Close Combat Attacks or when shooting with
other weapons.
Interacting Special Rules
Duplicated special rules
Sometimes a model may have the same special rule more than once, for example when a model gains a special rule that
it already had or gains the same special rule from two different sources. In such a case, the effects of the duplicated
special rules do not stack and do not offer any additional benefit, unless specifically noted otherwise. If the duplicate
special rules have different (X) values, choose the version with the highest one. If the X is the result of a dice roll, it
sometimes is not clear which X is the highest. In this case you may choose which rule to use (before rolling any dice).
For example, if a unit possesses Magic Resistance (2) and Magic Resistance (3), then it is considered to possess Magic
Resistance (3). As a counterexample, Fight In Extra Rank is one of the rare special rules specifically allowed to stack. A
unit that already has Fight In Extra Rank and gains Fight In Extra Rank is able to fight with two extra ranks.
Special Attacks
Special Attacks (like Stomp or Breath Weapon) are typically not made with the model's weapon. Special Attacks do not
benefit from special rules that modify normal Close Combat Attacks or normal Shooting Attacks (including special rules
that modify Characteristics). However, Special Attacks may benefit from other sources of rules (as long as they are not
special rules) or characteristics increases, such as spells or Magic Items. For example, a Great Weapon or Thunderous
Charge does not increase the Strength of Stomp attacks, but a Potion of Strength or the spell "The Beast Within" does.

List of Special Rules
Ambush
Before deploying an army that includes units with the Ambush special rule, you must state which of your units with this
special rule will use it (starting with the player that picked the Deployment Zone). Deploy your army as usual, but
without deploying any of the Ambushing units. Starting from Turn 2, roll a dice for each Ambushing unit at the start of
each of your Remaining Moves sub-phases. If a 3+ is rolled, the Ambushing unit enters the Battlefield from any table
edge. Place the arriving unit with all of its back rank touching the Board Edge. Ambushing models are free to move in
the Remaining Moves sub-phase, except that they may not March Move, and they must end this Movement Phase no
more than twice their Movement value from the Board Edge. If an Ambushing unit does not roll 3+ in any Remaining
Moves sub-phase before the game ends, it fails to enter the board. The unit counts as destroyed. An Ambushing
Character may choose to be deployed within an Ambushing unit that it would normally be allowed to join. In that case
the player rolls once for the combined unit.
Armour Piercing (X)
Close Combat Attacks made by parts of models with this special rule impose a -X penalty on the enemy's Armour Saves
taken against them (in addition to the normal modifier from the Strength of the attack). If an attack has more than one
instance of the Armour Piercing special rule, use the highest value available for the attack.
Bodyguard (X)
When a Character is joined to a unit in which at least one model has the Bodyguard special rule, that Character gains
Stubborn. When Characters or Character types are stated in brackets, Bodyguard only works for the specified
Characters or Character types.
Breath Weapon (X)
A model with a Breath Weapon can use it once during the game. It can be used either as a Special Shooting Attack or as a
Special Close Combat Attack.
* As a Special Shooting Attack (normally in the Shooting Phase): Choose a target using the normal rules for
Shooting Attacks. The attack has a Range of 6". This attack can be used even if the model Marched in the
previous Movement Phase as well as for a Stand and Shoot Charge Reaction.
* As a Special Close Combat Attack (normally in the Close Combat Phase): The attack is made at the model's
Initiative (or the Initiative for the relevant part of the model). Declare that you are using the Breath Weapon
when allocating attacks, and choose a unit in base contact to attack with it.
No matter if it is used as a Shooting or Close Combat Attack, a Breath Weapon causes 2D6 automatic hits on its target.
The Strength and the special rules (if any) of these hits are given within brackets, such as "Breath Weapon (Strength 4,
Flaming Attacks)".
Cannot March
Units with one or more models with this special rule cannot perform a March Move.
Channel
Each model with this special rule adds +1 to its side's Channel rolls. All Wizards have this special rule.
Crush Attack
A model part with this rule can exchange all of its normal Close Combat Attacks for a single Special Attack, which cannot
be made as a Supporting Attack, is resolved at Initiative 0, has Strength 10 and Multiple Wounds (Ordnance). The model
can still make Special Attacks like Stomp or Impact Hits.
91
Cumbersome
Shooting Weapons with this special rule or Shooting Attacks from model parts with this special rule can never Stand
and Shoot as a Charge Reaction.
Daemonic Instability
Units with this rule never flee from combat. Instead, the player rolls 2D6 like a normal Break Test, adds the result to the
Combat Score difference and then deducts the unit's Leadership value. Simplified formula: 2D6+CS-Ld . The test is failed
if the total is a positive number and the unit loses a number of Wounds equal to the value by which the test was failed.
These Wounds are distributed following the rules for Unstable with no saves of any kind allowed.
Devastating Charge
In the first round of a combat after a model with this rule has successfully charged into combat, model parts with this
special rule have +1 Attack.
Distracting
Close Combat Attacks allocated at a model with this special rule suffer a -1 penalty when rolling to hit. This to-hit
modifier cannot be combined with any other negative to-hit modifiers.
Divine Attacks
Successful Ward Saves taken against attacks with this special rule, or against Close Combat Attacks made by model
parts with this special rule must be rerolled.
Engineer
A model with this special rule allows a War Machine within 3" to use the Engineer's Ballistic Skill instead of its own and
to reroll any rolls on the Misfire Table. (If there are several War Machines within 3" of the Engineer, declare which one
will receive the Engineer's benefits this turn before firing it). If the War Machine has an Artillery Weapon type listed
below, there is an additional benefit. The War Machine may reroll:
* for Catapults: The Scatter Dice.
* for Flame Throwers: The D6 roll for the distance the Template moves, unless it is a '6'.
This rule cannot be used by a model that is Engaged in Combat.
Ethereal
Models with this special rule have Magical Attacks and a Ward Save (2+) which cannot be used against Magical Attacks.
Characters without the Ethereal special rule cannot join units that include R&F models with the Ethereal special rule.
Models with this special rule treat all Terrain as Open Terrain for movement purposes but cannot end their movement
inside (or within 1" of) Impassable Terrain. If a multipart model has this rule, mounts will only ever benefit from
Magical Attacks and treat all Terrain as Open Terrain (for the Ward Save and not being allowed to be joined, the rider
must have this special rule).
Fast Cavalry
Models with this special rule have Free Reform and Vanguard. If a unit consisting solely of models with Fast Cavalry
voluntarily flees as a Charge Reaction and subsequently rallies the next turn then the unit may move and shoot during
that turn. The rallied unit may not charge and counts as having moved for the purpose of shooting. This rule cannot be
applied if a unit fails to rally on the first turn or involuntarily flees, such as a result of a failed Panic Test.
Fear
All enemy units in base contact with one or more models with this special rule suffer a -1 Leadership modifier. Models
that are Immune to Psychology or that have Fear themselves are immune to the effects of Fear. At the start of each
92
Combat Round, units in base contact with one or more enemy models with Fear must take a Leadership Test. If this test
is failed, the models in the unit have their Weapon Skill reduced to 1 for the remainder of the Combat Round.
Fight in Extra Rank
Models with this special rule can make Supporting Attacks from an additional Rank. (So, normally, this means that
models with this special rule will be able to make Supporting Attacks from the 3rd rank). This rule is cumulative,
allowing an additional rank to make Supporting Attacks for each instance of this special rule.
Fireborn
Model parts with this special rule have a Ward Save (2+) against Flaming Attacks.
Flaming Attacks
This rule is applied to attacks made with this special rule and attacks from model parts with this special rule (both Close
Combat and Shooting Attacks). They don't normally have any special effect. However, they interact with other rules
(such as Flammable and Regeneration).
Flammable
Attacks with the Flaming Attacks special rule must reroll failed to-wound rolls against models with this special rule.
Fly (X)
Units composed entirely of models with this special rule can make Flying Movements in the Move Chargers and
Remaining Moves sub-phases. When a unit makes a Flying Movement, substitute the models' Movement Characteristic
with the value given in brackets (X). However, they cannot end their Movement inside or within 1" of a unit or
Impassable Terrain (unless charging, when the normal exceptions to the Unit Spacing rule apply). Units using Flying
Movement ignore any Terrain or units they fly over from their starting to their ending position, but they are still
affected by the effects of the Terrain from which they take off and in which they land. Flying Movement can be used to
March. Models with the Fly special rule also always have Swiftstride and Free Reform.
Free Reform
Units composed entirely of models with this special rule are allowed to make any number of Reforms when moving in
the Remaining Moves sub-phase, while they may still Advance or March. They are allowed to shoot even if they Marched
or Reformed. No model may move more than its Movement allowance (or twice that number if Marching), from its
starting position to its final position, around any obstructions (including the Unit Spacing rule). If a model performed
any action during the movement (such as Sky Serpents' Slashing attacks), the distance moved is counted from its
starting position to the point on the Battlefield where it performed that action and then to their its position. If at least
half of the models in a unit have the Free Reform special rule, the unit always counts as having 0 Full Ranks.
93
Frenzy
Model parts with Frenzy have +1 Attack and are Immune to Psychology. After all charges have been declared, each of
your units with one or more models (or model parts) with Frenzy must take a Frenzy Test (Leadership Test) if it did not
declare a charge. If the test is failed, the unit must declare a charge against the closest viable enemy unit, if there is one.
Characters are never forced to charge out of units. Units with one or more model parts with Frenzy must always pursue
and overrun whenever possible. If a model part with Frenzy is ever on the losing side of a Combat Round, it
immediately loses this special rule.
Grinding Attacks (X)
Model parts with this special rule can make a Special Close Combat Attack at their own Initiative against a single enemy
unit in base contact. This attack deals a number of hits equal to the value stated within brackets (X). These attacks
automatically hit and have a Strength equal to the model's own Strength. Grinding Attacks never benefit from any
equipment or special rule the model may have (since they are Special Attacks). If a model has both Grinding Attacks and
Impact Hits, it may only use one of these rules in the same Round of Combat (you are free to choose which one).
Hard Target
Shooting Attacks targeting a unit in which the majority of models have this special rule suffer a -1 penalty when rolling
to hit.
Hatred
Model parts with this special rule may reroll failed to-hit rolls during the first Round of Combat. Sometimes this rule
may only work against certain enemies, which are then stated in brackets. For example, "Hatred (Army Book: Empire of
Sonnstahl)" means that Hatred only applies when attacking models from the Empire of Sonnstahl Army Book.
Hellfire
At the end of a phase in which a unit has suffered one or more unsaved Wounds from a model part or an Attack with
this rule, the unit suffers an additional D6 Strength 1 hits. No saves of any kind can be taken against Wounds caused by
these additional hits.
Hidden
A model with this special rule can choose to be deployed as "Hidden". In this case secretly note in which friendly
(non-Character) unit it is hiding. This unit must already have been deployed, must have the same Troop Type as the
model with Hidden, and the model must be allowed to join it normally. If the hiding model is a unit Champion, it must
hide in its own unit.
While hidden, the model cannot be harmed or otherwise affected, nor affect the game in any way (e.g. attack or use or
benefit from Magical Items). Unless the unit that the Character is hiding in is fleeing, the model can be revealed at the
start or end of any Player Turn or at the start of any Round of Combat of a Close Combat that its unit is participating in.
Place the model inside the unit as if it just joined it, placing it as far forward as possible (Front Rank), except that it
cannot move other models with the Front Rank rule. Once revealed, the model functions as normal and this rule has no
fu
rther effect. If the model is never revealed during the game (for example, because its unit was destroyed), the hiding
model counts as killed.
Immune to Psychology
If half or more of a unit's models are Immune to Psychology, the unit automatically passes Panic Tests and cannot
declare a Flee reaction (unless already fleeing). Models that are Immune to Psychology are also immune to the effects of
Fear.
94
Impact Hits (X)
Impact Hits are Special Close Combat Attacks which can only be made in the first RoundofCombatafteramodelwith
this rule successfully charged into combat. Impact HitsareresolvedatInitiative10andinflictanumberofhitsequalto
the value stated within brackets (X) to a single enemy unit in base contact, which must be the charged enemy unit.
Impact Hits automatically hit and have a Strength value equal to the model's own Strength, with +1 to Strength for
every Full Rank after the first in the unit, provided that those ranks are comprised entirely of modelswiththeImpact
Hits special rule. Due to being Special Attacks, Impact Hits do not benefit from weapon bonuses or special rules. If a
model has both Grinding Attacks and Impact Hits,itmayonlyuseoneoftheseruleinthesameCombatRound(youare
fr
ee to choose which one).
Insignificant
Units consisting entirely ofmodelswiththisspecialruledonotcausePanicTestsinunitswithoutthisspecialrule.Only
Insignificant Characters can join units with Insignificant R&F models.
Large Target
A Large Target can never be joined or join a unit (unless it is a War Platform). A Large Target increases itsHoldYour
Ground or Inspiring Presence Range by 6". A model with Large Target is of Large Height.
Lethal Strike
If an Attack with this special rule,oraCloseCombatAttackfromamodelpartwiththisspecialrulerollsanunmodified
'6' to wound, this Wound has Armour Piercing (6) and Regeneration Saves cannot be taken against it.
Lightning Attack
Units with the Fly special rule that, suffer one or more hits during asinglephasefromattackswiththisspecialrule,or
attacks from model parts with this special rule, suffer an additional D6 Strength 4 hits at the end of that Phase.
Lightning Reflexes
Model parts with this special rule have +1 to hit with theirCloseCombatAttacks.Thisdoesnotapplyifthemodelpart
would be striking at initiative 0 (for example due to a Great Weapon ortheMesmericAllurespell).Ifthisisthecase,it
strikes at its own Initiative instead.
Magic Resistance (X)
All models in aunitwithoneormoremodelswithMagicResistanceaddthevaluewithinbrackets(X)toanyWardSave
rolls (using the same rules as for adding to Armour Saves) when rolling Ward Saves against Wounds caused by spell
effects. Magic Resistance, like most special rules, is not cumulative.
Magical Attacks
Attacks with this special rule or Attacks made by model parts with this special rule normally don't have any special
effect. However, they interact with other rules (such as Ethereal). Models with this special rule apply it to all their
attacks, including Special Attacks such as Stomp, ImpactHits,andBreathAttacks(unlessstatedotherwise).Alldamage
fr
om spells, Miscast hits and Magical Items causes Magical Attacks.
Metalshifting
Attacks with this special ruleorCloseCombatAttacksmadebymodelpartswiththisspecialruledon'trolltowoundas
normal. Instead, they always wound on a roll equal to or greater than the target's Armour Save. An unmodified '6'
always wounds and an unmodified '1' always fails to wound. These attacks have Armour Piercing (6) and Flaming
Attacks.
Move or Fire
Shooting Weapons or model parts with this special rule may not shoot if they moved during the current Player Turn.
95
Multiple Shots (X)
Shooting Weapons or model parts with this special rule may choose to fire multiple times instead of a single time, in
each Shooting Phase. How many times they can shoot is stated in brackets. However, using this special rule imposes a -1
to hit modifier on all shots fired. All R&F models in a single unit must use the Multiple Shots rule if at least one of them
uses this rule.
Multiple Wounds (X, Y )
Unsaved Wounds caused by attacks with this special rule or by Close Combat Attacks from model parts with this special
rule are multiplied into the value given in brackets (X). If the value is a Dice (such as "Multiple Wounds (D3)"), roll one
such Dice for each unsaved Wound with this special rule. The amount of Wounds that the attack is multiplied into can
never be higher than the Wounds Characteristic of the Target (excluding Wounds suffered previously in the battle). For
example, if a Multiple Wounds (D6) attack wounds a Troll (W3) and rolls a '5' for the amount of Wounds, this is reduced
to 3 Wounds.
If (Ordnance) is stated as the value in brackets, this normally counts as Multiple Wounds (D3+1), but against targets
with the Fly special rule this is increased to Multiple Wounds (D3+2).
Sometimes this rule is connected to certain Troop Types or special rules. If this is the case, the Troop Type will be given
within brackets (Y), for example Multiple Wounds (2, Infantry). If this is the case, only apply the Multiple Wounds rule
when attacking models of the given Troop Type or possessing the given special rules.
Not a Leader
Models with this rule can never be the General.
Otherworldly
Models with this special rule have Magical Attacks, are Immune to Psychology and have a Ward Save (5+). Units with
the Otherworldly special rule can only be joined by Otherworldly Characters. Similarly, Otherworldly Characters can
only join Otherworldly units.
Pathmaster
Wizards with this special rule do not randomly select spells as usual. Instead, they can freely choose their spells from
the Path stated in brackets (but they still cannot duplicate non-signature spells).
Poisoned Attacks
If an attack with this special rule, or an attack from a model part with this special rule (both Shooting and Close Combat
Attacks), rolls an unmodified '6' to hit, it automatically wounds with no to-wound roll needed. Shooting Attacks that
need a 7+ to hit (or more) can never benefit from Poisoned Attacks.
Quick to Fire
Shooting Weapons with this special rule or Shooting Attacks from model parts with this special rule don't suffer the -1
penalty for Moving and Shooting and can make a Stand and Shoot Charge Reaction regardless of the distance to the
charging unit.
96
Random Attacks (X)
A model part with this rule has a random number of Attacks equal to the value between brackets (before adding
possible modifier to it). For example, a model with Random Attacks (D3+2) can have between 3 and 5 Attacks. These
attacks ignore the limit which states that a model may have a maximum of 10 attacks.
Random Movement (X)
Units with this special rule cannot Declare Charges and cannot move in theRemainingMovessub-phase.Instead,they
move in the Compulsory Moves sub-phase. Models with this special rule always Charge, Flee, Pursue and Overrunthe
distance stated in brackets, and can never benefit from Swiftstride.
During the Compulsory Moves sub-phase, units with this special rule move using the rules for pursuing units, except
that they can freely choose which direction to rotate towards before rolling the Pursuit distance, cannot move off the
Board Edge and only take Dangerous Terrain tests iftheyactuallychargeanenemyunit(theystilltestasnormalwhen
fl
eeing, pursuing a broken enemy or Overrunning).
If a unit with this specialruleisgarrisoningaBuilding,itmustleaveitbyplacingtheunit1"awayfromtheBuilding(or
as close as possible) during the Compulsory Moves sub-phase, and then move, using the normal rules for Random
Movement. (It may not charge in the same turn. If it would, it stops 1" before the enemy unit instead).
Characters with Random Movement can only join units with the same special rule (by moving into contact with them
during theCompulsoryMovessub-phase),andunitswiththisrulecanonlybejoinedbyRandomMovementCharacters.
If a unit has several sets of Random Movement, use the lowest one.
Regeneration (X)
Regeneration is a special save, taken after a failed Armour Save. The value of the save will be stated in brackets.
Regeneration Saves cannot be taken alongside Ward Saves (if a model has both, it must choose which onetouse)and
cannot be taken against Flaming Attacks or Lethal Strike blows that rolled '6' to wound.
Requires Two Hands
A model wielding a Weapon with this special rule cannot simultaneously use a Shield.
Scout
Before deploying an army that includes units with Scout, you must state which of your unitswiththisspecialrulewill
use it, starting with the player thatpickedtheDeploymentZone.Deployyourarmyasusual,butwithoutdeployingany
of the Scouting units. These units are placed after all other non-Scouting units havebeendeployed.Theycaneitherbe
deployed in your Deployment Zone, using the normal rules, or theycanbedeployedoutsidetheDeploymentZone,but
must be more than 18" awayfromanyenemyunits.Scoutingunitsthataredeployedoutsidetheirplayer'sDeployment
Zone may not Declare Charges in the first Player Turn (if their side has the first turn). If both players have Scouting
units, alternate deploying one unit at a time, starting with the player that finished deploying first.
Scythes
Models with Scythes add +1 to their number of Impact Hits.
97
Skirmishers
Models with this special rule always also have Free Reform. Shooting at Skirmishers suffers a -1 to hit penalty.
Skirmishing models are not placed in base to base contact with each other. Instead, models are placed with a ½"
distance between them. Other than this gap between models, units of Skirmishers follow the normal rules for forming
units and therefore have a front, two flanks and a rear. Skirmishing units can only be joined by Characters that have the
same Troop Type as the unit. A Character which joins a unit of Skirmishers gains Skirmishers for as long as it remains
with the unit. The Character is always considered Mismatched for the purpose of placement within the unit unless it has
the exact same base size as the other Skirmisher models.
After Skirmishing units declares a Charges or a Charge Reaction other than Flee, they immediately contract their loose
fo
rmation into a normal formation. When doing this, the model closest to the charged or charging unit must not change
position, see Figure 14. If several models are equally close, the Active Player chooses which model is considered to be
the closest. Skirmishers regain their loose formation if they are not Engaged in Combat at the beginning of any
Movement Phase (of any player). Keep the centre of the front rank stationary. If there isn't enough room for the unit to
regain its loose formation, keep the unit in tight formation until the first place where there is enough room.
Stomp (X)
A model with this special rule can make a Special Attack in the Close Combat Phase at Initiative 0 against a single enemy
unit in base contact, provided that the Troop Type of the target unit is Infantry, War Beast, Swarm or War Machine. This
attack deals a number of hits equal to the value stated within brackets (X), which automatically hit and have a Strength
equal to the model's own Strength.
In multipart models, riders can never Stomp. Stomp attacks can only ever be allocated to models that can normally be
stomped. Being a Special Attack, Stomp never benefits from any equipment or special rule the model has.
Strider
Models with this special rule may ignore any movement effect caused by Terrain except Impassable Terrain and
Buildings and never lose their Steadfast or Rank Bonus due to Terrain. Sometimes this special rule is only linked to a
specific type of Terrain, stated in brackets. In this case, the Strider rule effect is only applied in relation to the specified
Terrain type.
Stubborn
A unit with at least one model with this special rule ignores any Combat Score penalties to its Leadership when taking
Break Tests or Combat Reform Leadership Tests.
Stupidity
At the start of a Player Turn, each of the Active Player's units with one or more models (or a part of them) with this
special rule must take a Leadership Test. If the test is failed, the unit must move D6" directly forward (stopping 1"
before Impassible Terrain or other units) in the Compulsory Moves sub-phase and may not perform any other
voluntary actions this Player Turn (such as charging, moving, shooting, casting spells and so on). If the model has no
fr
ont (i.e. the model is on a round base), randomize which direction to move in. All models with the Stupidity special
rule are also Immune to Psychology.
Swiftstride
When a unit composed entirely of models with this special rule rolls Charge Range, Flee Distance, Pursuit Distance or
Overrun Distance, it rolls an additional D6 (normally this will lead to rolling 3D6) and discards the lowest dice.
98
Terror
When a unit with one or more models with this special rule declares a Charge, its target must take a Panic Test. If the
test is failed, the target of the Charge must declare a Flee Reaction, if able to do so. All models with Terror also have the
Fear special rule and are immune to Fear and Terror.
Thunderous Charge
In the first round of a combat after a model with this rule has successfully charged, model parts with this special rule
receive a +1 Strength bonus to their normal Close Combat Attacks. This Strength bonus can only be used for Attacks
directed against the charged enemies.
Toxic Attacks
Attacks with this special rule or Close Combat Attacks made by models with this special rule are always Strength 3 and
Armour Piercing (6). Toxic Attacks have a -1 to wound modifier against models (or parts of them) with either the Mark
of the Dark Gods (Pestilence) or the Plague Cult special rule.
Unbreakable
Units with this special rule are Immune to Psychology and automatically pass all Break Tests. Characters with the
Unbreakable special rule can only join Unbreakable units. Unbreakable units can only be joined by Unbreakable
Characters.
Undead
Units with this special rule have the Unstable and Immune to Psychology special rules. Undead units cannot March,
unless they start their move within the General's Inspiring Presence Range. The only Charge Reaction an Undead unit
can make is Hold.
Unstable
Units with this special rule automatically pass all Break Tests. When a unit with this special rule loses a combat, it
suffers a Wound (without any saves allowed) for each point of Combat Score by which it lost the combat. Unstable units
receiving Hold You Ground reduce the number of Wounds caused by the Combat Score difference by 1. The Wounds are
distributed in the following order:
1. R&F models (excluding Champions)
2. Champion
3. Characters (distributed by the owner of the unit, as evenly as possible)
A unit with both Unstable and Stubborn halves (round fractions up) the number of Wounds caused by Unstable (apply
this before applying other modifiers to the number of caused Wounds).
Unwieldy
Shooting Weapons with this special rule or Shooting Attacks from model parts with this special rule suffer an additional
-1 to hit (for a total of -2) for Moving and Shooting.
99
Vanguard
After Deployment (including Scouts),unitscomposedentirelyofmodelswiththisspecialrulemayperforma12"move.
The move is performed as if in the Remaining Moves sub-phase, including any actions and restrictions theunitwould
normally have in the Remaining Movessub-phase(suchasWheeling,Reforming,joiningunits,leavingunitsandsoon).
The 12" distance is used instead of the unit's Movement Characteristic and no March Moves are allowed. This move
cannot be used to move within 12" of enemy units. Units that have moved in this way may notDeclareChargesinthe

Volley Fire
Shooting Weapons with this special rule or ShootingAttacksfrommodelpartswiththisspecialruleignoreintervening

War Platform
Models with this special rule may join units as iftheywereCharacters(eveniftheyarenotCharactersandevenifthey
are Large Targets), and follow the rules for Characters with regards to distributing hits. While joined to and moving
with a unit consisting of 5 ormoremodels(besidestheWarPlatformitself)amodelwiththeWarPlatformspecialrule
may March even though its Troop Type would normally forbid it, forexampleifitisaChariot.Whenjoinedtoaunit,it
must always be placed in the centre of the front rank (possibly pushing back models with the Front Rank rule). Ifthe
model cannot be placed in the centre of the the front rank (for example due to Mismatching bases or the front rank
being too narrow), the model cannot join the unit. This means that a War Platform can never join a unit with
Mismatching bases. Models with this rule lose Swiftstride.
Ward Save (X)
Ward Saves are special saves, taken after failed Armour Saves. The value of the save will be stated in brackets. Ward
Saves cannot be taken alongside Regeneration Saves (if a model has both, it must choose which one to use).
Weapon Master
At the beginning ofeachRoundofCombat,modelpartswiththisspecialrulemaychoosewhichweapontheyfightwith.
This includes selecting to use a Hand Weapon even if they have other weapons. If armed with a Magical Weapon, the
model must still use it.
Wizard Conclave (Spells)
The Champion of a unit with the Wizard Conclave special rule receives +1 Wound in addition to the normal
Characteristics increases associated with being a Champion and is a Level1WizardApprentice.ThisChampionknows
predetermined spells, which are defined within brackets. For example, the Champion of a Wizard Conclave(BlueFire,
Pink Fire) would be is a 1 Wizard Apprentice with two predetermined spells (Blue Fire and Pink Fire).

more than one weapon. A Magical Hand Weapon cannot be used to Parry.
Magical Armour
Most Magical Armour have a type, their mundane counterpart. They follow all the rules associatedwiththismundane
armour in addition to the rules stated in their description. If a Magical Armour is ever destroyed, it reverts to its
mundane type. If a model has an armour of the same type as its Magical Armour, the Magical Armour replaces it (for
example, if a model has Heavy ArmourandbuysaMagicalLightArmour,themundaneheavyarmourislost).AMagical
Shield cannot be used alongside a Hand Weapon to Parry.
A Magical Armour cannot be taken by Wizards, unless the Wizard has a mundane armour other than Innate Defence,
Mount's Protection and Barding or the option to buy it.
Talismans and Enchanted Items
No additional rules.
Arcane Items
Arcane Items can only be taken by Wizards.
Magical Standards
Only Standard Bearers can bear Magical Standards. They are usually either a unit's Standard Bearer or the army's Battle
Standard Bearer.

and restrictions. For example, a Magical Lance confers +2 Strength when charging and can only be used by mounted
models, War Beasts or Monstrous Beasts, exactly like a normal Lance would. If a Magical Item is destroyed it is
considered to revert to its mundane type.
102
Restrictions
* All Magical Items have the rule One per Army: they cannot be duplicated within an army.
* No model can have more than one Magical Item of the same category.
* Certain Magical Items may have additional restrictions associated with them.
Point Cost
Most Magical Items have a point cost displayed after theirname.SomeMagicalItemshavetwopointcostsinstead(e.g.
Giant Sword (60 pts / 50 pts) ). The first value has to be paid if the modelchoosingtheItemisaLordchoice,andthe
second if the model is a Hero choice.
Magical Items and Mounted Models
Magical Items often refer to their "wearer" or "bearer". These terms mean the same thing and refer to the part of the
model the item was bought for, excluding its mount . Other Items affect the "model" or the "wearer's model"; these
terms refer to the entire model including the mount (note that these terms override the restriction for Ridden
Monster's Profile). Finally, a third group of Items refers to the "unit"; these items affect the entire unit of the model
(including mounts).
One Use Only
These Items can only be used once. Once they are used, the Items count as eliminated for all game purposes.
