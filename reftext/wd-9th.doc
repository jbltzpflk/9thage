Fantasy Battles: The 9th Age is a community-made miniatures wargame.  All relevant rules, as well as feedback and suggestions, can be found/given here: http://www.the-ninth-age.com/

Army Special Rules
Gaze of the Gods: A model with this rule cannot refuse a challenge, and must issue one if no other model does so. Immediately after killing a non-champion model in a challenge or slaying a monster, the controlling player rolls on the table and confers to the part of the model that has Gaze of the Gods:
1 +1 Initiative If this is the second time receiving this gift, the model must take a toughness test. If the test passed, the model gains Stupidity. If the test is failed, the model turns into a Fallen Beast.
2 +1 Weapon Skill If this is the second time receiving this gift, the model gains Lightning Reflexes.
3 +1 Attack If this is the second time receiving this gift, the model gains Lethal Strike.
4 +1 Strength If this is the second time receiving this gift, the model gains Multiple Wounds(2).
5 +1 Toughness If this is the second time receiving this gift, the model may gain Ward Save (5+) or increase an existing Regeneration or Ward Save by +1, up to a maximum of 3+. The player decides which effect takes place.
6 +1 Leadership If this is the second time receiving this gift, the model may gain Stubborn or turn into a Daemon Prince. The player decides which effect takes place.  Re-roll any roll that results in getting a gift a 3rd time. If the model is a combined model, special rules or Characteristic increases from this special rule only affect the part of the model that has Gaze of the Gods.  When turning into a new model remove the old model from the board. It counts as being killed for all purposes, except for the King is Dead and the Their Flag is Down. Place the new model back on the the table within 6" of the old model's position. Keep it at least 1" away from all other models and impassable terrain. If the model is impossible to place within these guidelines, place it as close as possible to a legal position. This new model becomes your Battle Standard or General if replacing a model with that rule. Spawns only retain the mark of the old model, while Demonic Princes keep all Gifts, Magical or Mundane Items, and Marks. Fallen Beasts can never confer their Leadership to another model.

Marks of the Dark Gods
There are different Marks of the Dark Gods, each one with a different effect, explained below.
Which mark a model has is stated in brackets.
Models with a Mark of the Dark Gods (True Chaos) can join a unit with any Mark of the Dark Gods.
Models with a Mark of the Dark Gods other than True Chaos cannot join Units with one or more models with a Mark of the Dark Gods other than the same as themselves or True Chaos.
Wizards cannot join units with Mark of the Dark Gods (Wrath) or Chosen by the Gods (Wrath) models and cannot gain the Mark of the Dark Gods (Wrath) in any way.
Models who choose a Mark of the Dark Gods as an option must specify which mark they have on the army list.

* True Chaos: Units with majority of models with the Mark of the Dark Gods (True Chaos) may reroll failed Panic tests.
* Change: The bearer may gain one of the following bonus effect: Flaming Attacks, Ward-Breaker Attacks or Hellfire, which affects both close combat attacks and shooting attacks.  The effect must be chosen at the start of each combat phase and before shooting with a unit. Every model in a unit must choose the same bonus effect. Special Attacks such as Stomps or Impact Hits are not affected.  Characters with a Marks of the Dark Gods (Change) that are Wizards do not get above effect, instead they add a +1 modifier to their casting roll.
* Lust: Units with majority of models with the Mark of the Dark Gods (Lust) can reroll charge, pursuit and random movement rolls and are Immune to panic caused by 25% casualties (but not immune to any other kinds of panic: unit destroyed or broken within 6", terror-caused panic etc.).
* Pestilence: Enemy models attacking or being attacked by models with Mark of the Dark Gods (Pestilence) have -1 Weapon Skill (to a minimum of 1) when rolling to hit. Toxic Attacks are at -1 to wound against the model.
* Wrath: Parts of models with the Mark of the Dark Gods (Wrath) have +1 to hit in combat, are immune to Fear and cannot declare 'Flee' as a charge reaction.

Wizards with Marks
Wizards with Mark of the Dark Gods must use certain Paths depending on the mark chosen
* True Chaos Path of Heavens (Lord only), Alchemy, Shadow, Death or Fire
* Change Path of Change or Alchemy
* Lust Path of Lust or Shadows
* Pestilence Path of Disease or Death

Chosen by the Gods:
A model with this special rule is one of the few Chosen of the Dark Gods.
Those models gain an additional effect from their Mark of the Dark Gods.
These follow the same rules as Mark of the Dark Gods in relation to Characters joining units 
(for example, a character with Mark of the Dark Gods (Wrath) can not join a unit with Chosen by the Gods (Lust)).
True Chaos: +1 Leadership
Change: 6+ Ward Save (or improving their existing Ward Save by 1) and Wizard Conclave (Level 1: Path of Change: Blue Fire, Pink Fire) Special rule.
Lust: +1 Movement and Armour Piercing (1), or increases its existing Armour Piercing by 1. The additional Movement speed is also conferred to any Character with the Mark of the Dark Gods (Lust) that joins this unit.
Pestilence: +1 Toughness.
Wrath: +1 Strength.
Lightning Rage: The model has Ward Save (2+) against attacks with the Lightning Attack special rule. If a model is hit by Lightning Attack it gains Frenzy Special rule.
Inspire Greatness: As long as one or more models with this special rule are alive and in a unit of the same troop type as themselves, the unit can make an additional Supporting attack from the second rank (but not from the third rank). Mounts can still never make supporting attacks.

Giant Attacks: When a giant attacks in Close Combat, pick a target in base contact to attack and roll on the chart below. Giants have two types of attack patterns depending on the Troop Type of the target.
Against Infantry, War Beast, Swarm, Warmachine
and Cavalry targets:
1: Bellow
2: Jump
3: Grab
4-6: Swing
Against Monstrous Beast, Monstrous Infantry, Monstrous Cavalry, Chariot, Monster and Ridden Monster targets:
1: Bellow
2-3: Thump
4-6: Smash
Bellow: Neither the giant nor the chosen unit can make any Close Combat attacks this phase. Attacks already done (including those simultaneous with this attack) are not affected. The Giant's side automatically wins the combat by 2.  If two (or more) opposing Giants "Bellow", the combat is a draw.
Jump: The chosen unit suffers D6 hits with the Giant's Strength, carried out as if it were a Grinding Attack. The Giant must take a Dangerous Terrain test.
Grab: Select a single model in base contact with the Giant. This model must take a Strength and Weapon Skill test. For each failed test, the model suffers a hit with the Giant's Strength and Multiple Wounds (D3).
Swing: The Giant makes 2D6 attacks on the chosen unit.
Thump: Select a model from the chosen unit in base contact with the Giant. This model takes a Initiative test. If the test is failed, the model suffers 2D6 wounds with Armour Piercing (6).
Smash: Select a model from the chosen unit in base contact with the Giant. This model suffers 1 wound with Armour Piercing (6). If the model has not yet attacked it cannot attack in this round. It the model has already attacked, it cannot attack in the next player turn.
- Notes Giant Attacks counts as Close Combat attack and therefore are affected by all rules normally affecting Close Combat
attacks. After rolling on this chart, the Giant may still Stomp as normal.
