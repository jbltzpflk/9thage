Beast Herds Army Rules Version 0.11.0 Beta

Army Special Rules
PrimalInstinct: Models with this special rule may reroll failed to hit rolls in close combat on the condition that their unit passes a Leadership test at the start of the combat round.
Drunkard:
Units with this rule may gain two different sets of effect depending on whether they show up Sober or Drunk on the battlefield.
Sober: The Drunkard unit is miraculously sober for once. Each model gains Vanguard and Free Reform.
Drunk: The Drunkard unit is unbelievably drunk. Each model gains Immune to Psychology and Thunderous Charge. The Player may freely choose at the start of the game whether each Drunkard unit in the army shows up Sober or Drunk. Drunkard Characters may only join Drunkard units who are in the same state of sobriety (or lack thereof).
Pack Tactics: Units with this rule gain Swiftstride when charging an enemy's flank or rear but loses this rule if joined by any model who does not also have this rule.
Looted Booze: Units with this rule may change from Sober to Drunk at the beginning of the Player's turn. If a model with Looted Booze joins a unit that is Drunkard and uses this ability then the entire unit will change from Sober to Drunk. This rule has no effect on models who are already Drunk.
Blood Offering: Units that include at least one Character with this rule may reroll failed Panic tests, at the cost of inflicting one wound with no saves allowed to the Character who performed the Blood Offering. If available, a unit may reroll failed Panic tests using another mean that is less harmful (and bloody), such as benefiting from the influence of a nearby Battle Standard Bearer.
Half Horse:
Stomp hits can never be distributed to a model with this rule.

Armoury
Soothsayer Staff: Close combat weapon. Requires two hands. Models armed with a Soothsayer Staff may use this weapon in one of two manners, decided by the Player at the start of each combat round. The weapon may be used offensively, as a Great Weapon, or defensively, as a Hand Weapon which grants a +2 bonus to Armour Save.
Beast Axe:
Close combat weapon, +1 Strength, strikes at Initiative 0 (regardless of wearer's initiative). Wearer has +1 to its armour save.
Totems: Totems are special upgrades that certain Beast Herd Characters and Champions may take. Each Totem Bearer may cast a Bound Spell (power level 3) of type Augment which lasts one turn. Only one Totem Bound Spell can be active on a unit at a time. Champions and Characters do not carry the same Totems and are not subject to the same rules.
Character: Totem Bearers may target friendly units up to 18" away and may cast any of the Totem Bound Spells. An army may field a maximum of 3 Characters who carry Totems.
Champion: Totem Bearers may only target their own units and may only bring one Totem. The chosen Totem must be designated on the army list.

List of Totems
Gnarled Hide Totem The unit gains Innate Defence (6+) and the Distracting special rule.
Blooded Horn Totem The unit gains +1 Attack and Armour Piercing (2).
Clouded Eye Totem The unit counts as having Hard Cover and Magic Resistance (3).
Black Wing Totem The unit gains +3 Initiative and adds D6 to its charge distance.

Magical Items
Magical Weapons
Bragh's Thighbone  (75/50 pts) Type: Great weapon. No saves of any kind can be taken against attacks made by this weapon.
The Impaler  (40 pts) Type: Hand Weapon. Grants +2 Strength in the Close Combat Phase directly after the Model has charged into combat. The weapon can be shot using the rules for a Bolt Thrower Artillery Weapons: Range 18", Strength 6, Armour Piercing (6), Multiple Wounds (D3). Shots from the weapon don't suffer any to-hit modifiers.

Magical Armour
Greathorn Helm  (25 pts) Type: None (6+ armour save). The bearer may perform a close combat attack whenever he successfully passes an armour save against a close combat attack. These additional attacks cannot benefit from weapon bonuses and are immediately performed out of sequence, before removing Wounds from unsaved attacks.
Aaghor's Flayed Hide  (60/50 pts) Type: Light Armour. This item grants the bearer Regeneration (4+) and +1 Toughness.
Talismans
Pillager Icon  (25 pts) The bearer grants Vanguard to friendly units within 12" if they are comprised entirely of Razortusks, Chariots (excluding Character mounts), or Feral Hounds.
Eye of Dominance  (15 pts) The bearer can only be hit by rolls of '6' from attacks made by War Beasts, Monstrous Beasts, Monsters, Swarms, Cavalry mounts, Monstrous Cavalry mounts, Chariot beasts and Ridden Monster mounts. Crew and riders are unaffected by this effect.

Arcane Items
Gourd of Beetles  (35 pts) The bearer may cast Swarm of Insects from the Path of Wilderness as a Bound Spell (Power Level 4).

Enchanted Items
Crown of Horns (10 pts) The bearer automatically passes Primal Instinct tests, and so does any unit who may borrow the Character's Leadership.
Seed of the Dark Forest (40 pts) After all forces have deployed but before the game starts, the bearer may place a Dark Forest (size: no larger than 10" in length and 6" in width) on the battlefield, with its centre 12" or less away from the wearer. All friendly models within this Dark Forest (even partially) add 1 to their Casting Rolls for Augment-type spells, Hex-type spells and Totems.

Magical Standards
Banner of the Wild Herd  (60 pts) The bearer of the banner gains +1 Strength in close combat and grants this bonus to any unit it joins.

Giant Attacks: When a giant attacks in Close Combat, pick a target in base contact to attack and roll on the chart below. Giants have two types of attack patterns depending on the Troop Type of the target.
Against Infantry, War Beast, Swarm, Warmachine and Cavalry targets:
1: Bellow
2: Jump
3: Grab
4-6: Swing
Against Monstrous Beast, Monstrous Infantry, Monstrous Cavalry, Chariot, Monster and Ridden Monster targets:
1: Bellow
2-3: Thump
4-6: Smash
Bellow: Neither the giant nor the chosen unit can make any Close Combat attacks this phase. Attacks already done (including those simultaneous with this attack) are not affected. The Giant's side automatically wins the combat by 2. If two (or more) opposing Giants use "Bellow", the combat is a draw.
Jump: The chosen unit suffers D6 hits with the Giant's Strength, carried out as if it were a Grinding Attack. The Giant must take a Dangerous Terrain test.
Grab: Select a single model in base contact with the Giant. This model must take a Strength and Weapon Skill test. For each failed test, the model suffers a hit with the Giant's Strength and Multiple Wounds (D3).
Swing: The Giant makes 2D6 attacks on the chosen unit.
Thump: Select a model from the chosen unit in base contact with the Giant. This model takes a Initiative test. If the test is failed, the model suffers 2D6 wounds with Armour Piercing (6).
Smash: Select a model from the chosen unit in base contact with the Giant. This model suffers 1 wound with Armour Piercing (6). If the model has not yet attacked it cannot attack in this round. It the model has already attacked, it cannot attack in the next player turn.
- NotesGiant Attacks count as Close Combat attacks and therefore are affected by all rules normally affecting Close Combat attacks. After rolling on this chart, the Giant may still Stomp as normal.
