Army Special Rules
Greenhide Races
Different models in the army have a specific set of special rules depending on their race.
Common Orc
Unruly, Born to Fight
Iron Orc
Born to Fight, Weapon Masters,
Immune to Psychology
Feral Orc
Unruly, Born to Fight, Frenzy, Ward
Save (6+)
Common Goblin
Insignificant, Unruly
Cave Goblin
Insignificant, Unruly, Hatred (Army
book: Dwarven Holds)
Forest Goblin
Insignificant, Unruly, Strider
(Forests)
Unruly
Unruly units have -1 Leadership when rolling to restrain Pursuit Moves and Frenzy Tests. In addition, if they are in
horde formation, roll 3 dice for Panic tests and discard the highest dice.
Born to Fight
Model parts with this special rule have +1 Strength until they lose or draw a combat.
Waaargh!
Once per game, a model with this Special Rule that is the army's General may declare a Waaargh! at the start of the
Turn. All models in the army belonging to any Greenhide Race gain the Devastating Charge and Swiftstride special rules
until the end of the Player Turn.
Venomous Fangs
Nominate one attack from the model with this special rule before rolling to hit. This attack has the Multiple Wounds
(Ordnance) special rule.
2
Shambolic (X, mode)
Units with this Special Rule follow the Random Movement (X) Special Rule. Shambolic units are Immune to Psychology
and cannot be joined by characters. If this unit rolls for its Random Movement and all the dice show the same result, it
takes D3 wounds with no saves allowed and then moves in a randomized direction.
Shambolic Random Movement has two optional modes, stated in brackets.
Running Amok!!
Units with Shambolic (Running Amok!!) always move in
a randomized direction during their random movement.
Steady
Units with Shambolic (Steady) may re-roll their random
movement distance roll, but must accept the second one.
Boing!
Boing! units may move through friendly units during their move. If a Boing! unit would end its movement inside a
fr
iendly unit without also being in contact with an enemy unit, backtrack along its path until it is in a legal position (at
least 1'' away from any units).
Boing! units do not count as "touching" terrain (e.g. for the purposes for Dangerous Terrain tests) unless they begin or
end their move on it, but they are still blocked by Impassable Terrain.
Ricochet (X)
Ricochet models ignore the 1" unit spacing rule during their Random Movement. If a Ricochet model touches another
unit (friend or foe), it continues moving in the same direction until it is 1'' clear of the other unit. If this would cause it to
contact a third unit (or fourth, etc), the Ricochet model keeps moving in the same direction through units until it can be
placed (it must be at least 1'' away from other units or impassible terrain to be placed). If it cannot be placed through
this process it is removed as a casualty.
Any units passed through by a Ricochet model that is within the movement distance rolled are hit. The units that are hit
suffer X hits, where X is given in brackets. All units in same Close Combat that are hit are treated as a single unit for hit
purposes. Owning player distribute hits as evenly as possible between units, then follow normal rules for distributing
hits to models within each unit.
This is increased by an additional D6 hits if the Ricochet model was removed as a casualty because it couldn't be placed
anywhere.
Other units cannot charge Ricochet models, but may charge, flee, pursue or move through them. Units that do so take X
hits plus an additional D6 hits, and the Ricochet model is removed as a casualty.
All hits inflicted by Ricochet models are at the unmodified strength of the model and are Armour Piercing (1).
Accident Prone
When Accident Prone models contact any terrain feature except Open Terrain or Hills, contact the board edge, or stop
1'' away from Impassable Terrain, they must take a Dangerous Terrain test, which is failed on a roll of ‘1' or ‘2'. If two
Accident Prone units touch each other, they are both removed as casualties.
3
Armoury
Power ‘Shrooms
Generate D3+1 Power ‘Shrooms at the end of deployment. When declaring usage of Power Dice you may use a single
mushroom to add D3 to the casting result. If this dice rolls a natural ‘1', the Wizard takes a Strength 3 hit with Armour
Piercing (6).
Mammoth Stabber
Units with at least one Full Rank have Impact Hits (D3) with Strength 5 and Multiple Wounds (Ordnance; Large
Targets).

Special Rules: Shambolic (2d6, Running Amok!!), Accident Prone, Ricochet (1d6), Hard Target
Surprise!: Mad Gits are not deployed, but must be concealed inside their Cave Goblin unit. They are unit upgrades and
as such they are ignored when calculating victory points (their points are already included in the Goblin unit concealing
them). When Mad Gits are removed as casualties they do not cause Panic tests. They still move, act and are influenced
by special rules independently like normal units and do not count towards model count of units concealing them.
Mad Gits are used in two ways:
- Any number may be used as separate Stand and Shoot reactions. Normal Stand & Shoot reactions may also be taken.
- All must be used at the start of Shooting Phase if the unit is not in close combat and is within 8" of an enemy unit.
Resolve one model at a time. Place the Mad Git in base contact with the concealing unit (note that in this one case, the
Mad Git contacts a unit without inflicting hits on it) and choose a direction. Move the Mad Git 2D6'' in this direction. Mad
Git follows his own rules for movement in subsequent turns.

Options: pts

Giant Attacks: When a giant attacks in Close Combat, pick a target in base contact to attack and roll on the chart
below. Giants have two types of attack patterns depending on the Troop Type of the target.
Against Infantry, War Beast, Swarm, War Machine
and Cavalry targets:
1: Bellow
2: Jump
3: Grab
4-6: Swing
Against Monstrous Beast, Monstrous Infantry,
Monstrous Cavalry, Chariot, Monster and Ridden
Monster targets:
1: Bellow
2-3: Thump
4-6: Smash
Bellow: Neither the giant nor the chosen unit can make any Close Combat attacks this phase. Attacks already done
(including those simultaneous with this attack) are not affected. The Giant's side automatically wins the combat by
2. If two (or more) opposing Giants "Bellow", the combat is a draw.
Jump: The chosen unit suffers D6 hits with the Giant's Strength, carried out as if it were a Grinding Attack. The
Giant must take a Dangerous Terrain test.
Grab: Select a single model in base contact with the Giant. This model must take a Strength and Weapon Skill test.
