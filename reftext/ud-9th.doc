Undying Dynasties Army Rules Version 0.11.0 Beta

Fantasy Battles: The 9th Age is a community-made miniatures wargame.  All relevant rules, as well as feedback and suggestions, can be found/given here: http://www.the-ninth-age.com/

Army Special Rules
Rulers of the Dead: An Undying Dynasty army requires the Player to field a special model called an Hierophant. The Hierophant of the army must be a Wizard using the Path of Sands and must be designated as the Hierophant on the army list. The chosen character gains Regeneration (6+) and grants this effect to any unit it joins. Units suffer one less wound than normally inflicted by Unstable and Dust to Dust if within the range of the Battle Standard Bearer's Hold your Ground.
Dust to Dust: At the end of any phase in which the Hierophant is removed as a casualty, every unit in the army with one or more models with Dust to Dust must pass a Leadership test or suffer an amount of wounds with no saves of any kind allowed, equal to the amount by which the test was failed. These wounds are distributed following the rules for Unstable except they can never be distributed to models that do not have Dust to Dust. This is reduced by one wound if the unit received Hold Your Ground.  At the beginning of your next Player's Turn following the death of the Hierophant, a new Hierophant may be selected. In order to do so, the Player must nominate another eligible character who is a Wizard using the Path of the Sands. This character is your new Hierophant. If the army does not have any eligible character, every unit with the Dust to Dust rule must once again pass a Leadership test or suffer wounds as described above. This effect will repeat itself at the start of each of the owning Player's turn until the game ends.
Undead Constructs: Models with this special rule reduce the number of wounds caused by the Dust to Dust and Unstable Special Rules by 1.  Furthermore, models with this Special Rule are subject to Undead and Dust to Dust.
Undying Will: A character with this rule may confer its unmodified Weapon Skill to all Undead models that are part of its unit. The Player may chose to do so at the start of any Close Combat phase. If the Character is mounted on a Large Target, it may instead choose to confer this bonus to a friendly Undead unit within 6" or, if engaged in combat, to one friendly Undead unit engaged with the same enemy unit as the Character. In either case, the effect lasts until the end of the phase.
Necromantic Aura: All friendly units within 6" of one or models with this Special Rule reduce the number of wounds caused by Dust to Dust and Unstable by 1. Models with the Necromantic Aura cannot benefit themselves from Necromantic Aura.
Mummy's Curse: When a model with this rule is removed from play, the model which caused the final wound automatically suffers a Strength 6 hit with Armour Piercing (6). If more than one model was part of the action which brought the downfall of the character, the hit is randomly distributed like shooting.
Underground Ambush: A unit with this rule follows the same rules for Ambush with one exception: instead of entering the battlefield from a table edge, the designated unit must enter the board from a location called the Underground Point. To designate an Underground Point, the Undying Dynasties Player may select any point on the battlefield outside 3" of an enemy unit and outside 1/2" of impassable terrain. The point is then scattered 2D6" in a random direction. The Underground Ambush unit may be placed with with the front of its first rank, or back of its rear rank, touching the Underground Point. If the point ends beneath an enemy unit, place the Ambushing unit in base contact with this enemy's front facing instead (maximizing contact as normal). The arriving unit counts as having successfully charged with no charge reaction allowed. If it is not possible to place the Ambushing unit for whatever reason, the ambush is failed and the Player may roll again next turn.
Risen: Each unit's profile contains a Risen sub-section that determines the number of wounds healed or raised with No Rest in Death.

In addition the player may choose to use the Undying Will special rule in the shooting phase by bestowing his unmodified Ballistic Skill instead of his Weapons Skill.
