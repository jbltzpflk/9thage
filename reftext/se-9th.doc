Army Special Rules

The terrain feature may not be larger than 27 cm in length and 19 cm in width. All Forests on the table are considered Dangerous Terrain.
Forest Walker: Models with this special rule have the Strider (Forest) special rule. Close Combat Attacks from model parts with this special rule have Armour Piercing (1), with the exception of models with the Otherworldly special rule. If a unit is comprised entirely of models with this special rule and starts the Close Combat Phase with the majority of its models in a Forest, all model parts with this special rule have Fight in Extra Rank and may reroll to-wound rolls of '1' in Close Combat for the duration of that phase. Wizards may add an additional +1 to Channel attempts if the army has one or more models with this rule channeling from within a Forest.
Master Archers: Models with this special rule count as being equipped with the following Fey Arrows (see Armoury): Truemark Arrow, Starlight Shaft, Perforating Tip and Jewelweed Shot.
