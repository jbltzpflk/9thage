Army Special Rules
Cold-Blooded: When a model with this special rule takes a Leadership test, roll one additional D6 and remove the highest rolled D6.  
Born Predator: Part of Models with this special rule may reroll to hit rolls of '1' in close combat.
Palanquin: When a model with this special rule is in a unit with 5 or more models with the Bodyguard special rule, it loses the Front Rank rule. A model with this special rule can be the General even if it is also the Battle Standard Bearer and ignores all penalties when refusing a challenge.
Telepathic Link: A Cuatl Lord may cast spells of type "Damage" through a model with this special rule within 24". When casting through the vassal, measure range from the Telepathic Link and use its forward arc and Line of sight. The Cuatl Lord may cast spells of type "missile" even if it is engaged in combat as long as the Telepathic Link isn't. If the spell is miscast, the Cuatl Lord rolls on the miscast table as normal and the Telepathic Link suffers a Strength PDU+1 hit. If you cast a spell through a Telepathic Link, the attribute gets cast through it as well.

Weapons:

Armour: Innate Defence (4+)
Caiman Special Rules: Cold-blooded, Born Predator, Strider (Water)
Combined Strength: Skink Braves may add Caimans to their unit. These Caimans are Rank and File models of a different unit type (Monstrous Infantry). The unit is considered Infantry if there are more Skinks than Caimans and Monstrous Infantry if the number of Caimans are equal to or more than the number of Skinks. Caimans follow the rules for matching bases (see Front Rank), except that they do not have to be placed as far forwards as possible, but can be placed anywhere in the unit.
Attacks towards the unit as a whole (such as most Ranged Attacks and Special Close Combat Attacks) that are distributed to R&F models in the unit are randomized: roll a D6 for each hit: on a 1-4 it hits a Skink, on a 5-6 a Caiman.  After that roll to wound and saves as normal, using the Toughness and saves of the Skinks (for all attacks that get allocated to Skinks) and the Toughness and saves of the Caiman (for all attacks that get allocated to Caiman). Close Combat Attacks towards R&F models work the same way, randomize the attacks BEFORE rolling to hit, then roll to hit as normal (comparing your WS with the WS of the Skinks for all attacks that get allocated to Skinks, and the same procedure for the Caimans). As long as 5 or more Caiman models are part of the unit, any Caiman Ancient in the unit cannot be distributed hits to and any template hit is transferred to a R&F Caiman instead. When casting a spell that raises wounds on a combined unit distribute the raised wounds the same way as above (1-4 Skink, 5-6 Caiman.)
